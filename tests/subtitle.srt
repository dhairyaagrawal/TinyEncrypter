00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,105
<i>Fuck Wolverine.</i>

3
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:19,847
<i>First, he rides my coattails
with the R rating.</i>

4
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:24,286
<i>Then the hairy motherfucker
ups the ante by dying.</i>

5
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,506
<i>What a dick.</i>

6
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:28,769
<i>Well, guess what, Wolvie?</i>

7
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:31,641
<i>I'm dying in this one, too.</i>

8
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:36,777
<i>To understand
why I took a cat-nap</i>

9
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:38,910
<i>on 1,200 gallons
of high-test fuel...</i>

10
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:40,302
<i>I need to take you back</i>

11
00:02:40,346 --> 00:02:42,783
<i>to the dewy slopes
of six weeks ago.</i>

12
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:44,176
<i>I'd gone international,</i>

13
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,134
<i>taking out mass murderers,
gangsters,</i>

14
00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:47,875
<i>unspeakable monsters.</i>

15
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,878
<i>People nobody would touch.
Except me.</i>

16
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,880
<i>I'm gonna touch them all over.</i>

17
00:02:56,536 --> 00:02:58,451
<i>Hey, it's Gail calling.</i>

18
00:02:58,494 --> 00:02:59,626
<i>Love the shiny suit.</i>

19
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:01,410
<i>Really brings out
the sex trafficker in your eyes.</i>

20
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:08,678
I don't speak Cantonese,
Mister...

21
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,855
Well, I'm not even gonna
attempt that.

22
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:13,379
But I did take
8th grade Spanish, so...

23
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,558
Which literally translates to...

24
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:21,648
I don't bargain, pumpkin fucker.

25
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:34,139
Oh. Oh, this isn't Gilbert's.

26
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:35,444
I am so sorry.

27
00:03:35,488 --> 00:03:37,118
I thought this was
an anal-bleaching party.

28
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:01,557
Don't worry.
You're not going to die.

29
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:03,690
Although these will kill you.

30
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:04,952
Hit it, Dolly.

31
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:26,626
I'm merely
a vessel for the Lord.

32
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:40,466
Taking the hands out
of the guns of the criminals!

33
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,519
Whoo! Do not go in there!

34
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:59,311
Let's see
Captain America do that.

35
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:09,799
Too exotic?

36
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:34,928
Oh, God! Oh, God, time out!
Time out!

37
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:38,497
Cut. I've got bad guy blood,
right in my open eye.

38
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,542
Oh, that's so gross.

39
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:43,850
Fuck.

40
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:45,784
Looks like you left
a little landing strip there.

41
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:46,853
I like it.

42
00:06:51,988 --> 00:06:53,599
Oh, man!

43
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,909
<i>My world tour brought me home</i>

44
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,390
<i>to this guy,
Sergei Valishnikov.</i>

45
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:03,957
<i>But we'll get to him
in a moment.</i>

46
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,437
<i>'Cause I know
what you're thinking.</i>

47
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,222
<i>"I'm so glad
I left the kiddos at home."</i>

48
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:09,963
<i>But that's where
you'd be wrong.</i>

49
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:12,748
<i>That babysitter of yours
is high as fuck right now...</i>

50
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:17,101
<i>and, believe it or not,
Deadpool 2 is a family film.</i>

51
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:18,928
<i>True story.</i>

52
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:22,149
<i>And every good family film
starts with a vicious murder.</i>

53
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:25,283
<i>Bambi, The Lion King, Saw 7.</i>

54
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:28,634
<i>Holy shit pickles!
That guy's on fire.</i>

55
00:07:28,677 --> 00:07:31,593
<i>That's not CGI, folks.
He's actually on fire.</i>

56
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:35,031
<i>Yeah. You know I get paid
to take out bad guys, right?</i>

57
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,294
<i>But this guy?</i>

58
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:38,296
<i>He was one of the worst of 'em.</i>

59
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,517
<i>Hurry up and open
this fucking door,</i>

60
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,712
<i>and let's kill
this motherfucker!</i>

61
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:52,832
<i>Ugh. So gross.</i>

62
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,704
<i>A panic room? Really?</i>

63
00:07:55,748 --> 00:07:57,967
Can you come out?

64
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,101
I really have to go.
It's my anniversary.

65
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,432
<i>Over and over, I hear people say,</i>

66
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,023
<i>"I just don't have
enough confidence."</i>

67
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,156
<i>Listen, confidence is not
something you have.</i>

68
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,635
<i>It's something you create.</i>

69
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:15,594
<i>And you can create it
at any moment in time.</i>

70
00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:17,335
<i>A sense of confidence
is nothing</i>

71
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:19,119
<i>but a sense of power
within yourself...</i>

72
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:20,705
<i>a sense of certainty that
you can pull something off.</i>

73
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:22,818
Start the fucking car!

74
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:23,993
Dopinder!

75
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,560
Start the fucking car!

76
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,741
Shoot that motherfucker!
Shoot him!

77
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:34,308
- Whoo!
- Oh, I shit my pants.

78
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:36,745
Actually, that may have been me.

79
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,051
Oh, mission accomplished?

80
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:40,227
Oh, in a George W. sort of way.

81
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,968
Fucker can't stay
in a panic room forever.

82
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:43,467
Oh, you're living the dreams, DP.

83
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:45,667
It has been
quite the run, Dopinder,

84
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:47,016
and who'da thought?

85
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,497
Now I'm talked about
in the same sentence as Jesus.

86
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,412
<i>Passion of the Christ,</i> then me.

87
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:52,718
At least domestically.

88
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:53,980
We beat them overseas,

89
00:08:54,023 --> 00:08:56,025
where there's no such thing
as religion.

90
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,245
I do want to live
the dreams, Pool Boy.

91
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:00,682
Taxiing is not as sexy
as it looks.

92
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:02,510
- I want to fill my...
- Pockets?

93
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:05,774
What's your poison?
A little, uh, cokey cokey?

94
00:09:05,818 --> 00:09:07,167
Can't maintain an erection

95
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:08,753
without buying shoes online?

96
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:10,736
I've never experienced
that last one.

97
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:12,172
Talk to me, Goose.

98
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:14,914
I was going to say "soul".
I want to fill my soul.

99
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:18,047
I want to belong to something,
like you, Pool, sir.

100
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,049
- Dopinder...
- Hmm?

101
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,921
You never cease
to surprise me.

102
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:26,055
You know, the depth of
your heart is extraordinary.

103
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,753
We all need
a sense of belonging.

104
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:29,581
We all need
a genuine sense of home.

105
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:30,756
A place in this world.

106
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,159
I want to become
a contract killer.

107
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:34,020
I'm sorry. What did you say?

108
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:36,022
Remember when
I kidnapped Bandhu

109
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:37,391
and threatened him
with great violence?

110
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:39,025
You kind of killed him.

111
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:40,655
And then remember the movie
<i>Interview with the Vampire?</i>

112
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,854
Don't want to.

113
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:42,985
When Tom Cruise fed

114
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:44,857
10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst blood

115
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,119
for the first time...

116
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:48,556
and she looked up
at his smooth,

117
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,819
handsome face and said...

118
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:53,387
"I want some more."

119
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:57,086
Oh, Pool, picture me,
a 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst.

120
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,829
I'll never not picture that.

121
00:10:00,873 --> 00:10:02,657
But I can't wait
to never speak of this,

122
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,746
as soon as possible.

123
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,271
We're here.

124
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,062
Dopinder, it's me again.

125
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:17,803
Look, a saner man
might discourage you

126
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:19,718
from joining
the deadly merc business...

127
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,241
what, with your concave chest

128
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:22,938
and your
paper towel tube arms.

129
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:24,679
But you're an eagle...

130
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:26,725
and goddamn it,
an eagle's gotta soar.

131
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:28,161
You gotta grab those dreams,

132
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:29,815
grab those dreams
by the dick tip...

133
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:31,382
and make it rain!

134
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:33,340
I don't know what that means.

135
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:35,342
Me neither.

136
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:37,431
I'm gonna see you...

137
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:40,086
at the office.

138
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:41,783
In the sky.

139
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:42,958
You're my Tom Cruise!

140
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:44,612
And you're my Kristen Dunst!

141
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:46,135
Kristen? Kirsten?

142
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,794
Sorry I'm late.

143
00:10:52,838 --> 00:10:54,405
There was a bunch of

144
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:56,537
handicapable children
stuck in a tree...

145
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,104
- and I had to, uh...
- Uh-uh.

146
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:00,889
You're right.
I was fighting a caped badass.

147
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:03,283
But then we discovered
his mom is named Martha, too.

148
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:05,633
- No.
- You got me.

149
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:07,461
I was rounding up
all the gluten in the world

150
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:08,723
and launching it into space...

151
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,899
where it can't not
hurt us ever again.

152
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:12,118
Try again.

153
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:14,250
Diarrhea?

154
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:16,054
We can't be sure
until I get this suit off...

155
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:18,951
but, uh,
all signs point to yes.

156
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:21,867
Traffic?

157
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:23,521
Hmm?

158
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:26,393
Kiss me
like you miss me, Red.

159
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:27,437
Well, come here.

160
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:41,582
I'm gonna shower
and get out of this suit.

161
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:42,801
Don't you want
your surprise?

162
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:44,672
Do I look like
a patient burn victim?

163
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,718
I got one for you, too.

164
00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:49,373
Happy anniversary, baby.

165
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,983
Open, open, open.

166
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:54,726
Skee-Ball token.

167
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:56,162
Our first date.

168
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:57,772
Yup.

169
00:11:57,816 --> 00:12:00,471
That's genuine,
high-grade lead.

170
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:05,693
I'll keep it forever.

171
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:07,173
Thank you, baby.

172
00:12:08,783 --> 00:12:10,481
- Open yours.
- All right, all right.

173
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:12,700
Oh...

174
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:15,984
That's just the most
beautiful thing that I've...

175
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:17,401
I don't know
what this is.

176
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:19,272
My IUD.

177
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:20,491
A bomb?

178
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:23,624
No, dick for brains.
My birth control device.

179
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:24,756
What, you mean that your...

180
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,540
Baby factory's open
for business.

181
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:27,889
Oh, my God!

182
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:31,197
Oh, my God! I want a boy!

183
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,330
Or a little girl!
Definitely one or the other!

184
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:37,159
Oh! And I want our kid
to have only one name.

185
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:40,989
Like Cher or Todd.

186
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,817
You gotta pump a baby
in me first, cowboy.

187
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,210
Yes, I do.

188
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:45,753
Let's watch some porn
and show that bed who's boss.

189
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:46,778
Let's do that.

190
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:50,129
<i>♫ Papa... ♫</i>

191
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:52,348
<i>♫ Can you hear me? ♫</i>

192
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:56,440
<i>♫ Papa, can you see me? ♫</i>

193
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:58,703
Does this song
sound familiar to you?

194
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:03,185
May.

195
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:06,928
Connor, if it's a boy.
May, if it's a girl.

196
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,020
So weird.

197
00:13:12,064 --> 00:13:14,458
Family was always
an F-word to me.

198
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:20,333
My pile of shit father
took off and bailed.

199
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:22,596
I mean, it's not like I have
a lot of strong role models

200
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,380
to draw off of for Todd.

201
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,167
Hey. Look at me.

202
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,475
You are not your father.

203
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:34,652
Besides...

204
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:39,439
I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.

205
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,485
But here's the thing,

206
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,356
isn't that how
it always works?

207
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,923
Like in <i>Star Wars,</i>

208
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:47,665
men are destined
to become their father...

209
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,798
and then have consensual sex
with their sister?

210
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:54,149
I think you missed
big, big chunks of that movie.

211
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:56,456
No, I'm pretty sure
Luke nailed her.

212
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,545
Baby, that's <i>Empire.</i>

213
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,200
The point is, kids...

214
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,334
they give us a chance
to be better than we are.

215
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:08,816
Better than we used to be.

216
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,384
You're a lot smarter
than I look.

217
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:14,082
I'm gonna go make dessert.

218
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:18,565
You get the strap-on.
Let's make a super baby.

219
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:22,003
Pretty sure it doesn't work
that way, but we can try.

220
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:25,572
What about Krystal?
But with a "K"?

221
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,574
It's too stripper-y.

222
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,141
Kevin with a "K"!

223
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:31,273
No, too stripper-y, too.

224
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,754
Uh, Earl!

225
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:36,148
He's gonna go straight to jail

226
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:38,411
if we name him Earl.

227
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:40,326
What about Bruce?

228
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:42,763
No.

229
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:43,851
Get down.

230
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:45,287
What?

231
00:15:14,186 --> 00:15:16,275
Baby? Baby?

232
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:21,236
I'm okay.

233
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,935
Thank God I didn't have to use
the cream cheese spreader.

234
00:15:58,534 --> 00:15:59,797
Please.

235
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:06,717
Please. Please.

236
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,937
Baby, I'm so sorry.

237
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:13,767
No!

238
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,998
<i>♫ Papa, can you hear me? ♫</i>

239
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:23,739
Is it just me, or does

240
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:25,369
<i>Do You Want to Build
a Snowman?</i> from <i>Frozen...</i>

241
00:19:25,393 --> 00:19:26,699
sound suspiciously like

242
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:28,701
<i>Papa, Can You Hear Me?</i>
from <i>Yentl?

243
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,183
<i>♫ Papa, can you hear me? ♫</i>

244
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:36,578
And nobody
fucking realizes it.

245
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:38,189
Wade, you gotta go home.

246
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:40,974
You've been sitting here
for three days, okay?

247
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:44,717
You smell like sauerkraut
left in the warm rain.

248
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,067
Like wet garbage
in hot urine.

249
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:49,287
You smell like
a dog ate kitty litter...

250
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,376
and then farted his way
out of the living room.

251
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,247
I mean, like Rush Limbaugh's

252
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,119
couch cushions
after Shark Week.

253
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:56,903
I love <i>Frozen.</i>

254
00:19:56,947 --> 00:20:00,515
I loved her. I loved her
like an ocean loves water.

255
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,082
An ocean is water.

256
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:06,870
More importantly, I liked her.
I really liked her, you know?

257
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:08,045
George Michael was right.

258
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:09,916
I'm never gonna
dance again. Fuck!

259
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:11,526
He's dead, too.

260
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:14,051
At least we still have Bowie.

261
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:15,835
Oh, Mr. Pool.
David Bowie is...

262
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:17,141
Uh, uh, uh...

263
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:18,359
still with us.

264
00:20:18,403 --> 00:20:21,275
We do.
We'll always have Bowie.

265
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:22,929
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,409
Shot after shot,

267
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:26,300
it's not gonna change the fact
that I think you're...

268
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:27,954
Are you pissing?
Are you urinating right now?

269
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,894
You're making the face that
you make when you urinate.

270
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:32,504
- Is he pissing?
- I'm on it!

271
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:34,027
There you go, Dopinder.

272
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:36,116
If you want to be
a contract killer...

273
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,727
you gotta handle a mop
before you handle a gun.

274
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:39,835
Although I don't
quite understand

275
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:41,426
how they are at all similar.

276
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:43,578
'Cause I could shove either
one up your ass and kill you.

277
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:44,733
Now, leave me.

278
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:45,778
I get it.

279
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,911
Go home, Wade.

280
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:50,304
I don't have a home,
Weas, you know. I got a...

281
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,133
Okay, I'm fine.

282
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:54,308
I'm fine.

283
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:56,180
You know what "fine"
stands for, Wade?

284
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:59,966
Fucked up, insecure,
needy, and emotional.

285
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,228
According to the...

286
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:04,014
- Kubler-Ross.
- Yeah.

287
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:05,929
According to
the Kubler-Ross model...

288
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:08,757
denial is just one of
the five stages of grief.

289
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,151
Jesus Christ, Buck!

290
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:13,110
No more speaking lines
for you.

291
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,121
<i>Hey, bud. Bud.</i>

292
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:26,253
<i>- Huh?
- Got a match?</i>

293
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:27,820
<i>Match?</i>

294
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,343
<i>Yes, I have one right here.</i>

295
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:30,755
<i>Don't make a move.
This is a stick-up.</i>

296
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:32,520
<i>- What?
- You heard me.</i>

297
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:34,609
<i>Mister, Mister,
put down that gun.</i>

298
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:37,264
<i>Shut up. Now, come on.
Your money or your life?</i>

299
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:49,189
<i>Look, bud. I said,
"Your money or your life."</i>

300
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,538
- "I'm thinking it over!"
- <i>I'm thinking it over!</i>

301
00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:51,975
Motherfuck!

302
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:53,063
Fuck!

303
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,545
The hell you doin' here?

304
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:59,678
Don't you know how to knock?

305
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:01,636
I thought you saw me...

306
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,203
with your ears.

307
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:04,311
You're lucky I didn't
shoot you in the...

308
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:05,379
The wall?

309
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:08,817
The refrigerator?
I'm in so much pain.

310
00:22:11,603 --> 00:22:13,213
I heard the news, sweetie.

311
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:15,346
I'm very sorry. I am.

312
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:17,304
What am I gonna do, Al?

313
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:19,045
Probably something terrible.

314
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,613
Knowing you.

315
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:23,180
It was my fault.

316
00:22:24,398 --> 00:22:27,097
I fucking did this.

317
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,012
And all I wanna do
is grab her and see her

318
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:31,014
and tell her that I'm sorry,
and I can't.

319
00:22:33,016 --> 00:22:34,669
She's gone.

320
00:22:34,713 --> 00:22:38,499
Sweetheart, can you speak up?

321
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:39,805
It's a little hard
to hear you

322
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:41,546
with that pity dick
in your mouth.

323
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:44,636
Now, look, sugar.
You need to just keep living.

324
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:45,985
Thank you...

325
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:49,032
Matthew McConaughey,
your words are a treasure.

326
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:51,121
Listen to the pain.

327
00:22:51,164 --> 00:22:53,949
It's both history teacher
and fortune teller.

328
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:57,605
Pain teaches us
who we are, Wade.

329
00:22:57,649 --> 00:23:01,522
Sometimes, it's so bad,
we feel like we're dying.

330
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:04,264
But we can't really live till
we've died a little, can we?

331
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:08,007
Wade?

332
00:23:10,444 --> 00:23:12,620
- Wade?
- I'm right here, Althea.

333
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:15,275
And that is
the most beautiful thing

334
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,537
I've ever heard.

335
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:18,844
And you're absolutely right.

336
00:23:22,717 --> 00:23:25,068
I'm about to do
something terrible.

337
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:32,379
Precious, aren't they?

338
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:34,642
Whoa!

339
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:36,122
Are you a superhero?

340
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,863
Fucking A, sweetie.

341
00:23:37,906 --> 00:23:39,473
What's your name?

342
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:41,301
Captain Delicious Pants.

343
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:43,521
Who's Captain Delicious Pants?

344
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:10,896
I can't believe
he's still alive.

345
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:13,420
I can't believe you left
the house in that shirt.

346
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,858
There's gotta be
some way to die.

347
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:18,947
I just need to die harder.

348
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:20,210
Trademark Fox.

349
00:24:20,253 --> 00:24:21,254
Y'all caught up now?

350
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:36,182
<i>Open for business.</i>

351
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:42,188
<i>Your crazy matches my crazy.</i>

352
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,384
<i>I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.</i>

353
00:24:44,408 --> 00:24:45,670
<i>Skee-Ball token.</i>

354
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:46,993
<i>You're a lot smarter
than I look.</i>

355
00:24:52,894 --> 00:24:54,176
<i>About why we're so good together.</i>

356
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,395
<i>I love you, Wade Wilson.</i>

357
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,423
Ness?

358
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:02,034
Ness?

359
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:04,428
Ness.

360
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:07,170
Ness, there's something here.
I can't get to you.

361
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:11,391
Your heart's not
in the right place.

362
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:14,089
Wait, hold on. What?

363
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:16,222
Your heart's not
in the right place.

364
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,658
Wait. What do you mean

365
00:25:17,702 --> 00:25:18,766
my heart's not in the right place?
What does it...

366
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:41,421
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss, Wade.

367
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,031
You're broken.

368
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:46,034
Oh, God. I know that voice.

369
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,535
Well, Russell.

370
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:11,234
I hear you're handy
at picking locks.

371
00:26:12,626 --> 00:26:14,846
There will be no need
for that here.

372
00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:18,197
There's no locks on our doors,
no bars on our windows.

373
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:21,592
I know what you're thinking.

374
00:26:21,635 --> 00:26:24,290
Why don't the kids just run?

375
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,293
Who would choose to stay
in such a place?

376
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,817
You stay because...

377
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:34,605
deep down inside, you know
you're unfit to leave.

378
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:40,001
But don't worry.

379
00:26:41,176 --> 00:26:42,830
We can fix that.

380
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:51,404
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand.

381
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,080
"Heart's in the right place."

382
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:16,579
"Heart's in the right..."
What does that mean?

383
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:18,518
Take your mask off, Wade.

384
00:27:18,562 --> 00:27:20,259
I wish you'd said "pants".

385
00:27:20,303 --> 00:27:21,521
Let's play a game.

386
00:27:21,565 --> 00:27:24,089
It's called
"Adrien Brody or Adam Brody?".

387
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:26,483
Now, close your eyes
and open your mouth.

388
00:27:26,526 --> 00:27:28,354
You don't need
to be funny here.

389
00:27:28,963 --> 00:27:30,225
We must talk.

390
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:32,750
You need fresh start.

391
00:27:32,793 --> 00:27:34,360
Such a glare.

392
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,667
It's like I'm on stage
at the Gaiety.

393
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,322
With training,
you can be X-Man.

394
00:27:39,365 --> 00:27:41,454
You're wasting your time,
Shiny Jesus.

395
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:42,803
I'm not X-Man material.

396
00:27:42,847 --> 00:27:44,414
Understatement of the year.

397
00:27:44,892 --> 00:27:45,893
Wade, Yukio.

398
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:48,287
Yukio, Wade.

399
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:50,420
What in the fuck knuckles
is this?

400
00:27:50,463 --> 00:27:53,118
She's my girlfriend,
you intolerant shit.

401
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:54,989
Whoa! Pump the hate brakes,
<i>Fox & Friends.</i>

402
00:27:55,033 --> 00:27:56,904
I'm just surprised
anyone would date you.

403
00:27:56,948 --> 00:27:59,559
Especially Pinkie Pie from
<i>My Little Pony.</i>

404
00:27:59,603 --> 00:28:01,431
I like this guy.

405
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:03,563
Give him a chance.

406
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:04,714
It's great seeing you
like this.

407
00:28:04,738 --> 00:28:06,914
Yeah.

408
00:28:07,393 --> 00:28:08,699
Bye, Wade!

409
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:11,223
Now, some ground rules
while under our roof.

410
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:14,052
"Rule number one: No killing...

411
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:17,534
"anyone ever,
no matter how bad.

412
00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:20,232
"Rule two: Label everything
in refrigerator."

413
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:21,276
Wade?

414
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:23,409
Wade?

415
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,280
- Don't try to chase me.
- Wade!

416
00:28:25,324 --> 00:28:27,413
I'm not ready
to be touched again.

417
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:29,676
All these old guys
on the wall.

418
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,809
Who lives here,
Calista Flockhart?

419
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:37,031
Those were already damaged
after they fell there!

420
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:38,946
What am I supposed
to do around here, anyway?

421
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,253
Sit in a share circle,
talk about my feelings?

422
00:28:41,296 --> 00:28:44,169
And how would I
do that exactly?

423
00:28:44,212 --> 00:28:46,650
'Cause where the fuck
is everyone?

424
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:47,912
It's always just you

425
00:28:47,955 --> 00:28:49,280
and Negasonic Teenage
Longest Name Ever...

426
00:28:49,304 --> 00:28:50,523
Enough!

427
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:52,395
I said no touching!

428
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,443
What the fuck?

429
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,663
You'd think the studio
would throw us a bone.

430
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:02,535
One that doesn't end up
in my mouth.

431
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:03,773
The first movie
made more money

432
00:29:03,797 --> 00:29:06,147
than the guy
who invented pants.

433
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:08,367
They can't just dust off
one of the famous X-Men?

434
00:29:08,411 --> 00:29:10,500
How 'bout that putz
with the giant pigeon wings?

435
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:11,849
What do those do anyway, huh?

436
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:13,372
Carry him
three feet off the ground

437
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,461
to snatch up
the nearest muffin crumb?

438
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:17,681
No, no, no!

439
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:20,466
I am not X-Man material
at all.

440
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,164
First off...

441
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:25,253
I'm not even a virgin.
Second and more...

442
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:28,518
I should have left you

443
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:30,302
in the self-pitying mess
I found you in.

444
00:29:30,345 --> 00:29:33,436
But this is what friends do.
They show up!

445
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:35,481
Not when convenient or easy.

446
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:39,833
When hard,
and you always make it hard.

447
00:29:39,877 --> 00:29:42,357
You are unwell.

448
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:44,490
I'm sticking my neck out
bringing you here.

449
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:46,449
Wait. One of the assholes

450
00:29:46,492 --> 00:29:47,972
who killed Vanessa got away.

451
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,716
Oh, Jesus Christ!

452
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,650
I thought you were gonna
kiss me for a second there.

453
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:56,609
Please know I wouldn't be
able to stop you if you did.

454
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:58,678
Wade, whoever they are...

455
00:29:58,722 --> 00:30:01,072
we track them down
and bring them to justice.

456
00:30:01,638 --> 00:30:03,074
It was me.

457
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:08,558
I'm the asshole who got away.

458
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:11,735
I killed every last one
of them, except me.

459
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:13,476
Couldn't kill me.

460
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:18,611
We were gonna start a family.

461
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,397
We were, uh...

462
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:25,357
We were gonna be a family.

463
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,272
Wade...

464
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:30,101
Vanessa is gone.
She's not coming back.

465
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:34,018
This may not be
family you want...

466
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:36,499
but it's family you need.

467
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:37,804
You have a good heart.

468
00:30:37,848 --> 00:30:39,414
It belongs here
where it can grow.

469
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:42,200
What did you say?

470
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:45,551
About my heart?

471
00:30:50,991 --> 00:30:52,993
I think
I'm in the right place.

472
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,629
<i>I'mma tell you
what the big lie is.</i>

473
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,283
Toilet paper.

474
00:32:05,326 --> 00:32:06,719
What's so bad
about toilet paper?

475
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:07,981
Gets the job done.

476
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:10,897
Does it really
get the job done?

477
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:13,160
All right. Say you wake up
tomorrow morning...

478
00:32:13,204 --> 00:32:17,904
and, hypothetically, find some
fresh shit on your face.

479
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:19,665
Your cheek, maybe
a little bit in the beard.

480
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,405
What the hell?
I'm about to be fucking sick!

481
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:22,517
What do you do?

482
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:23,867
Do you go to a bathroom

483
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,608
and tear off
a piece of dry tissue...

484
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:27,522
and rub it around
on your beard a little bit

485
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:29,133
and then go on,
get on with your day?

486
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:30,787
Go to church,
maybe dinner and a movie,

487
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,962
like nothing happened?

488
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:33,398
Where is this
coming from, man?

489
00:32:33,441 --> 00:32:34,660
But something did happen.

490
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:36,183
Your face smells like shit.
Right?

491
00:32:36,227 --> 00:32:37,794
So what you would do,

492
00:32:37,837 --> 00:32:40,100
is you would get some soap,
you'd get some hot water...

493
00:32:40,144 --> 00:32:42,494
and you would scrub
the fucking shit

494
00:32:42,537 --> 00:32:44,539
out of your beard
for 10 straight minutes.

495
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,280
You could not scrub it enough.

496
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:47,978
Are you trying
to make me feel disgusting?

497
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:49,240
I'm starting to feel...

498
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:51,982
Toilet paper is
a pretty fine appetizer.

499
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:54,332
But, then...

500
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,682
Huggies Natural Care
wet wipes.

501
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:58,118
That's your main course.

502
00:32:58,162 --> 00:33:02,079
They're soft, they're moist.
They're for babies.

503
00:33:02,122 --> 00:33:04,908
Finally, one more pass
with toilet paper,

504
00:33:04,951 --> 00:33:06,866
maybe clear out
that excess moisture.

505
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,563
Maybe treat yourself
to a blow and go,

506
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:09,913
if you can get you
a hair dryer.

507
00:33:09,956 --> 00:33:12,306
Just about 30 seconds
would do you good.

508
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:17,007
The fuck?

509
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:19,313
Year.

510
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:21,315
What?

511
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,188
What year is it?

512
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:26,669
What kind of dumbass question
is that to ask?

513
00:33:57,438 --> 00:34:00,224
<i>We have 8 weeks of
boot camp ahead of us, men.</i>

514
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:01,616
<i>That'll get us
toned and prepared</i>

515
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,227
<i>for all manner of combat.</i>

516
00:34:05,316 --> 00:34:09,537
Not working out at all.

517
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,235
Masking tape.

518
00:34:11,278 --> 00:34:13,628
It is no friend
to chilled aluminum.

519
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,719
Velcro.
Color-coded, efficient,

520
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:17,807
environmentally friendly.

521
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,157
Who is he talking to?

522
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,874
And why is he dressed like
a registered sex offender?

523
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:23,900
Can we focus
for a moment, ladies?

524
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:26,250
Please, we need to talk about
next month's meal plan.

525
00:34:26,293 --> 00:34:28,078
Obviously,
everyone hated the ceviche.

526
00:34:28,121 --> 00:34:29,470
I read the suggestion box.

527
00:34:29,514 --> 00:34:31,124
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

528
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:33,170
I see through this weak act.

529
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:37,565
You may have fooled Colossus
with this nice guy shit...

530
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:38,784
but not me.

531
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:39,916
Don't be mean.

532
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,308
Back off, NTW.

533
00:34:41,352 --> 00:34:43,571
No, no, no. Let her go.

534
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:44,790
Let her go, it's okay.

535
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,400
She has a right
to be skeptical.

536
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:49,055
Look at me.
I'm an easy target.

537
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,623
You know, historically,

538
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:53,581
mischief has been
my mistress...

539
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:56,280
so I understand, you know.
But I like to think...

540
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,198
that you guys have
really rubbed off on me.

541
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:03,321
I like to think that I've
rubbed off around you, too.

542
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:07,247
A lot.

543
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,946
And for the first time
in a long while...

544
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:11,164
I like me.

545
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:15,908
- I accept your apology.
- I never apologized.

546
00:35:15,952 --> 00:35:17,518
I was talking to your heart.

547
00:35:17,562 --> 00:35:19,956
See? You're not
lost cause you thought.

548
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:23,220
I'm proud. You're everything
I knew you can be.

549
00:35:23,263 --> 00:35:25,265
Thank you, Colossus.

550
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:26,919
Just trying to be
the world's best X-Man.

551
00:35:26,963 --> 00:35:28,399
Sorry, X-Person.

552
00:35:29,966 --> 00:35:32,664
Hmm. Something wrong
with the soap.

553
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:34,318
It's fine.

554
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:36,581
I just filled it. Give it
a few more pumps there.

555
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,280
Now, if you'll excuse me...

556
00:35:40,324 --> 00:35:42,108
it's dust bunny season...

557
00:35:42,152 --> 00:35:43,153
and I'm hunting wabbits.

558
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:44,981
Bye, Wade!

559
00:35:47,157 --> 00:35:49,724
- Fuck.
- Fuck you.

560
00:36:01,388 --> 00:36:03,956
No one is born perfect.

561
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,002
But you can be.

562
00:36:06,045 --> 00:36:08,395
I know you're doing
what comes naturally.

563
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,532
You can't help yourself.

564
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:20,494
But you can.

565
00:36:20,538 --> 00:36:23,628
It takes work, discipline...

566
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:24,890
and treatment.

567
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:26,631
Your abilities...

568
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:31,375
I know how seductive they are.

569
00:36:31,418 --> 00:36:34,552
How powerful
they make you feel.

570
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:37,120
But you must learn
never to use them...

571
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:39,774
so they will never use you.

572
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:47,608
Please don't cry.

573
00:36:48,435 --> 00:36:50,046
I'm going to help.

574
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:53,266
I'm gonna make you feel
what you should feel.

575
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,834
How you need to feel...

576
00:36:55,878 --> 00:36:59,229
every time you're tempted
to act upon your urges.

577
00:36:59,272 --> 00:37:03,189
Suck my mutant dick,
you four-eyed fuck.

578
00:37:17,595 --> 00:37:18,813
Wade.

579
00:37:19,814 --> 00:37:21,381
Wade!

580
00:37:21,425 --> 00:37:23,514
Come in!
Hey, I was just doing

581
00:37:23,557 --> 00:37:25,472
a little bit
of light reading here...

582
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:26,952
We have mission.

583
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,519
Well, you guys be
safe out there.

584
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:29,824
I'll be praying for you.

585
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:32,262
No, I want you to join.

586
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,655
I'm sorry, what?

587
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,309
You heard me.

588
00:37:36,353 --> 00:37:38,746
Trust me,
that's a terrible idea.

589
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,878
I'm really not ready.

590
00:37:39,922 --> 00:37:41,619
- You are ready.
- I'm not.

591
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:43,534
Be at the X-Jet in five.

592
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:44,752
I can do thirty.

593
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,754
- Now.
- I can do now.

594
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:48,017
Final offer.

595
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,628
<i>Irene Merryweather, WHIT News.</i>

596
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:52,673
<i>Live here at a breaking news
situation</i>

597
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:55,372
<i>at the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation.</i>

598
00:37:55,415 --> 00:37:57,374
A mutant boy
is appearing to have

599
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,897
some sort of an incident...

600
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:00,440
- with police here behind me.
- Get away from me!

601
00:38:00,464 --> 00:38:02,901
There are two police vehicles
that are overturned.

602
00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:04,400
- There are open fires.
- Fuck off! Stay back!

603
00:38:04,424 --> 00:38:05,488
A scene of absolute chaos here.

604
00:38:05,512 --> 00:38:06,644
Calm down.

605
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:09,299
I'll burn you! You stay back!

606
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,823
Get away from me!

607
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:14,347
You wanna fucking die?

608
00:38:29,362 --> 00:38:32,583
And it appears as if the X-Men
are arriving...

609
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:34,150
Scatter!

610
00:38:34,193 --> 00:38:36,195
...with what appears
to be a trainee.

611
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,242
Everyone, calm down!
The pros are here. I...

612
00:38:39,285 --> 00:38:40,460
We're the X-Men!

613
00:38:40,504 --> 00:38:43,028
A dated metaphor for racism
in the '60s.

614
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:45,596
So, respect.

615
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,901
At ease, Officer.

616
00:38:48,468 --> 00:38:49,992
What are you doing?

617
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,776
My job!

618
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:53,219
You're the one who said
I was ready,

619
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:54,779
and I frankly disagreed
with you.

620
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:57,216
But here we are, trying to
overcome our differences.

621
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,697
Like Beyonce says, "Please...

622
00:39:00,524 --> 00:39:01,916
"Please, stop cheating on me."

623
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,048
Hey!

624
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,484
This is the fifth incident.

625
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:06,747
This kid needs to be
in the Ice Box, not here.

626
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,445
Russell belongs in our care.

627
00:39:08,488 --> 00:39:10,273
Not in prison. I assure you...

628
00:39:10,316 --> 00:39:11,467
we have everything
under control.

629
00:39:11,491 --> 00:39:12,599
Stay back! I'll burn you!

630
00:39:12,623 --> 00:39:13,841
Not getting a real

631
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,974
"under control"
vibe here, Marty.

632
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:18,063
- It is Glen, isn't it?
- Daniel.

633
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:19,325
I'll ask the questions,
Miguel.

634
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:20,718
Let me talk to the kid.

635
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:25,592
You stay here with your weird,
secret sex lips.

636
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,378
You wanna die?

637
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:29,616
This kid's adorable.

638
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,660
I don't know why I packed
the hollow points.

639
00:39:30,684 --> 00:39:31,859
I'll burn your balls off!

640
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:35,254
First day. I'm so nervous!

641
00:39:35,298 --> 00:39:36,864
Did you just say
"hollow points"?

642
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,257
Yeah, probably should've

643
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:40,346
brought a Super Soaker.

644
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:41,913
Hi, there!

645
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:45,699
Stay back
or Justin Bieber dies!

646
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:49,225
Justin Bieber.
He called you Justin Bieber.

647
00:39:50,617 --> 00:39:52,291
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!

648
00:39:52,315 --> 00:39:55,448
Okay, let's not do
whatever that is.

649
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:57,015
Okay? Let's just talk!

650
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:58,669
It's Russell, right?

651
00:39:58,712 --> 00:40:00,975
- Firefist.
- Firefist.

652
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:03,239
Ooh, that's a great name.
Where does it burn?

653
00:40:03,282 --> 00:40:05,082
Just the fist, or all the way
up to the elbow?

654
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,422
Definitely all
the way up to the elbow.

655
00:40:12,465 --> 00:40:15,294
Come quietly,
or there will be trouble.

656
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:18,123
- You stole that from <i>Robocop!</i>
- That's from <i>Robocop!</i>

657
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:19,820
Just stand down!

658
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:21,953
You're embarrassing me.
Look, Fire...

659
00:40:23,302 --> 00:40:25,826
Oh, my God! I can't say it!
I'm so sorry!

660
00:40:30,353 --> 00:40:34,357
Oh, shit!
That fucking does it!

661
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,793
Put your hands
behind your knees

662
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:37,316
and get down
on your head! Now!

663
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,623
Wade! What was first rule?

664
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:41,625
Label everything
in the refrigerator!

665
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:44,280
- Do not escalate!
- Rules are meant to be broken!

666
00:40:44,323 --> 00:40:45,759
That's the exact opposite

667
00:40:45,803 --> 00:40:47,152
of what they're meant for!

668
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:50,155
Fuck! Fine!

669
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,809
I'll start from the beginning.

670
00:40:51,852 --> 00:40:54,203
My name is Deadpool,
and I'm an X-Man.

671
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:56,205
- Trainee!
- Shut it!

672
00:40:57,162 --> 00:40:59,425
Look, I get it.

673
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,211
All right, you're scared.

674
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:03,864
Alone.

675
00:41:03,908 --> 00:41:04,996
You got no family.

676
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,104
I didn't have
a family, either.

677
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:07,868
You live in this dump.
Guess what?

678
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:09,609
I used to live in a shithole
just like it.

679
00:41:10,523 --> 00:41:11,872
But you know something?

680
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:13,657
A wise woman
once said to me...

681
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,180
"Speak up."

682
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:18,052
"I can't hear you with that
pity dick in your mouth."

683
00:41:18,096 --> 00:41:19,706
Too much? I went too far.

684
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:29,194
That was effervescent.

685
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:31,501
Stay in school, kid.

686
00:41:31,544 --> 00:41:33,372
Or don't. I didn't.

687
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:35,026
And I'm an X-Man.

688
00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:36,201
Trainee.

689
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:37,594
Fuck it!

690
00:41:37,637 --> 00:41:39,378
Superhero landing coming up!

691
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,644
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck!

692
00:41:44,688 --> 00:41:46,777
That is so not practical.

693
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:09,408
I could get used
to this X-Man shit.

694
00:42:09,452 --> 00:42:10,603
Trainee!

695
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:11,845
Trainee!

696
00:42:11,889 --> 00:42:13,673
Get a power restraint
on him. Now!

697
00:42:13,717 --> 00:42:16,937
Calm down, squirt.
It's over. We got ya.

698
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:20,332
What's that do?

699
00:42:20,376 --> 00:42:21,899
Power-dampening collar.

700
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:23,248
Shuts down
all mutant abilities.

701
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:26,120
You can't get it off.
Unless you've got a grenade.

702
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:29,167
Huh. Could've used
one of those in the first act.

703
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:30,429
Thank you!

704
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:34,520
That was absolutely thrilling.

705
00:42:34,564 --> 00:42:36,783
True heroism in action.

706
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:38,481
We are in your debt.

707
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:40,961
We can take it from here.

708
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:43,225
Take me
to the Ice Box, please!

709
00:42:43,268 --> 00:42:44,443
Anywhere's better than here.

710
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:45,749
Believe me, son,

711
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:47,533
you do not wanna go
to the Ice Box.

712
00:42:47,577 --> 00:42:50,188
That place makes Hitler's anus
look like Waikiki.

713
00:42:50,232 --> 00:42:52,103
Let's get you inside,
young man.

714
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:54,148
No, wait, wait. Wait.

715
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:55,672
You guys stay there.

716
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:07,379
Those guys hurt you?

717
00:43:08,815 --> 00:43:09,860
Who?

718
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:14,604
Baldilocks? Jared Kushner?

719
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:17,563
Both of 'em?

720
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:23,003
Oh, fuck it.

721
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:24,614
Four or five moments!

722
00:43:24,657 --> 00:43:25,702
I'm sorry?

723
00:43:25,745 --> 00:43:28,922
Four or five moments!

724
00:43:30,184 --> 00:43:32,926
That's all it takes
to be a hero.

725
00:43:33,971 --> 00:43:36,278
People think
you wake up a hero...

726
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:38,454
brush your teeth a hero...

727
00:43:38,497 --> 00:43:41,413
ejaculate into
a soap dispenser a hero.

728
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:46,549
But, no, being a hero
takes only a few moments!

729
00:43:47,898 --> 00:43:49,552
A few moments...

730
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:52,294
doing the ugly stuff
no one else will do.

731
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,907
No!

732
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:00,843
Stand down!
Hold your fire!

733
00:44:00,867 --> 00:44:03,217
- Wade, what did you do?
- Colossus, no!

734
00:44:03,261 --> 00:44:06,525
You were right, Wade.
You are not X-Men material.

735
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:08,875
No shit, Shiny Gandhi!

736
00:44:08,919 --> 00:44:10,399
What was your first clue?

737
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:13,576
The hollow point
through that fuckhead's face?

738
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:14,925
That kid was abused!

739
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:17,014
- You can tell. You can always tell!
- We have rules!

740
00:44:17,057 --> 00:44:19,799
You are not judge,
jury or executioner!

741
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:22,802
Fuck your rules!
I fight for what's right!

742
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:24,674
And sometimes
you gotta fight dirty!

743
00:44:24,717 --> 00:44:27,764
You let me down
for the last time, Wade.

744
00:44:30,897 --> 00:44:33,204
Okay, get these guys in the pod.

745
00:44:33,247 --> 00:44:35,424
Take them to the Ice Box.

746
00:44:56,053 --> 00:44:57,054
Hey, baby!

747
00:44:58,142 --> 00:45:00,405
I wonder what gang
I'll be in.

748
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:01,928
Yeah!

749
00:45:01,972 --> 00:45:04,235
Is there, like, a Sorting Hat? Hi.

750
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:07,499
I've always seen myself as

751
00:45:07,543 --> 00:45:08,935
more of an East Coast
Hufflepuff.

752
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:13,418
I've made a critical error
on my Airbnb reservation.

753
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:17,335
This is not what the website
looked like at all.

754
00:45:18,902 --> 00:45:20,643
I love the decor though.

755
00:45:20,686 --> 00:45:22,645
I had no idea
hopeless was a color.

756
00:45:22,688 --> 00:45:23,950
Hard left, douchebag.

757
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:29,695
Please, after you.

758
00:45:31,828 --> 00:45:34,526
Another disgusting minority
off the streets.

759
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,701
We'll sleep well tonight.

760
00:45:35,745 --> 00:45:36,789
Let's get a bagel.

761
00:45:40,053 --> 00:45:42,882
Nighty-night,
you annoying prick!

762
00:46:18,657 --> 00:46:20,548
You're a long way
from your superpowers.

763
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:23,009
Yeah. Just a touch of cancer.

764
00:46:23,053 --> 00:46:25,534
Not to worry,
we're old friends.

765
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:26,796
Fuck!

766
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,015
I wanted to be a superhero.

767
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:31,017
Always wanted
a real super suit.

768
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:32,628
What happened?

769
00:46:32,671 --> 00:46:34,791
When was the last time you saw
a plus-sized superhero?

770
00:46:35,457 --> 00:46:36,936
Never.

771
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,764
The industry discriminates.

772
00:46:39,852 --> 00:46:41,941
Fuck superheroes.

773
00:46:41,985 --> 00:46:44,248
The thing that
pisses me off the most...

774
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:46,119
I never stood up
for myself in there.

775
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,646
My whole life.

776
00:46:50,689 --> 00:46:54,171
I've been waiting for someone
to come and save me.

777
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:59,524
Nobody's gonna sacrifice
anything for me.

778
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:05,922
I gotta start taking care
of myself.

779
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:10,013
I have a mission now.

780
00:47:10,056 --> 00:47:12,711
The first thing I wanna do
when I get out of here...

781
00:47:12,755 --> 00:47:15,105
burn the headmaster alive...

782
00:47:15,148 --> 00:47:18,848
and then take a selfie
with his smoldering corpse.

783
00:47:18,891 --> 00:47:21,328
Aw. That's, like,
my favorite part of the Bible.

784
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:25,550
I don't have
a sock puppet on me...

785
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:27,639
but what did he do to you?

786
00:47:27,683 --> 00:47:29,293
Did he taste the rainbow?

787
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:31,382
I'd whisper it,
but Skittles would sue us.

788
00:47:32,557 --> 00:47:34,559
Fucker hates mutants.

789
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:36,561
He tried to beat
the genes out of us.

790
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:39,129
Nothing worse than
a "pray the gay away" type guy.

791
00:47:39,912 --> 00:47:41,305
Sick piece of shit.

792
00:47:42,698 --> 00:47:46,397
Tomorrow, we'll find
the biggest guy in here...

793
00:47:47,354 --> 00:47:49,052
and we'll make him our bitch!

794
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:54,318
What was that?

795
00:47:54,361 --> 00:47:56,929
That is the biggest guy
in here.

796
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:59,062
Fun fact about the Ice Box...

797
00:47:59,105 --> 00:48:00,933
though no one's ever seen it,

798
00:48:00,977 --> 00:48:03,196
they keep a monster
in the basement.

799
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,981
Right next to a huge,

800
00:48:05,024 --> 00:48:06,548
steaming bowl
of foreshadowing.

801
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,201
Look.

802
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:11,465
I can't protect you.

803
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:12,641
With this collar on,

804
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:15,818
my superpower
is just unbridled cancer.

805
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:19,343
Give me a bow and arrow,
I'm basically Hawkeye.

806
00:48:19,386 --> 00:48:21,475
Now, if you'll excuse me...

807
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:24,696
I've got tumors to grow.
Vanessa awaits.

808
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,220
I'll start by making us
a shank.

809
00:48:27,264 --> 00:48:29,179
- Good listening.
- I stole that guard's pen...

810
00:48:29,222 --> 00:48:31,181
and stashed it
in the old prison wallet,

811
00:48:31,224 --> 00:48:32,617
if you know what I'm saying.

812
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:35,141
I really hope I don't know
what you're saying.

813
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,581
I know it's in there,
I just need to get it out.

814
00:48:39,624 --> 00:48:41,713
Oh, Jesus Christ.

815
00:48:41,757 --> 00:48:44,411
I can hear you
rummaging around in there.

816
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,849
Do they make Purell
for your ears?

817
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:52,735
<i>And to update you</i>

818
00:48:52,768 --> 00:48:54,160
<i>on the story reported earlier,</i>

819
00:48:54,204 --> 00:48:55,901

820
00:48:55,945 --> 00:48:58,556
<i>outside the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation...</i>

821
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,905
<i>two mutants were arrested</i>

822
00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:01,690

00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,213
<i>Entering repair mode.</i>

824
00:49:07,565 --> 00:49:09,151
<i>...several police cars
were destroyed</i>

825
00:49:09,175 --> 00:49:11,003

828
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:39,205

829
00:49:39,249 --> 00:49:41,991
<i>now off-limits

830
00:49:43,732 --> 00:49:45,124
Psst!

831
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:49,781
Don't do that.

832
00:49:49,825 --> 00:49:52,697
What? Why are you
winking at me?

833
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:57,702
I got your back.

834
00:49:57,746 --> 00:49:58,964
Oh, my God.

835
00:49:59,008 --> 00:50:00,531
You're sick,
I gotta protect you.

836
00:50:00,574 --> 00:50:02,489
Just leave me alone, kid.

837
00:50:03,621 --> 00:50:04,666
Oh, great.

838
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:09,061
Well, hello there, new fish.

839
00:50:09,105 --> 00:50:12,151
It's nice to see some
fresh faces around here.

840
00:50:12,195 --> 00:50:14,458
I've done some
light catalog work...

841
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:16,982
but, really, modeling is just
a stepping stone to acting.

842
00:50:17,026 --> 00:50:19,811
- I was talking to him.
- Oh.

843
00:50:19,855 --> 00:50:23,249
Have we met?
I can't place your mustache.

844
00:50:23,293 --> 00:50:25,948
- Black Tom Cassidy.
- White Wade Wilson.

845
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:29,429
What's your superpower?
Cultural appropriation?

846
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:32,041
You're supposed to be
the toughest cunt in here.

847
00:50:32,084 --> 00:50:34,652
You don't look
like much to me.

848
00:50:34,696 --> 00:50:37,133
First rule of the yard,
fuckface...

849
00:50:37,176 --> 00:50:39,222
find the biggest guy
and make him your...

850
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:45,271
Second biggest guy.

851
00:50:45,315 --> 00:50:47,752
The last thing I need
is more hepatitis.

852
00:50:47,796 --> 00:50:51,364
Oh, it's slippery, too.
This table needs a wipe down!

853
00:50:51,408 --> 00:50:53,236
Can we get a wipe down
on the table?

854
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:56,761
Kid, I think you picked
the wrong side.

855
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:59,155
No, I didn't!
He's my friend!

856
00:50:59,198 --> 00:51:01,461
Zip it. We're not friends.

857
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:04,439
You're about to get
dick-slapped.

858
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:18,565
I had so much fun!
You were like...

859
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,698
And I was like,
"Take a seat, shit dick."

860
00:51:20,742 --> 00:51:22,482
Just let me die in peace.

861
00:51:22,526 --> 00:51:24,658
We make a great team!

862
00:51:24,702 --> 00:51:27,270
Oh, God! We're not a team.

863
00:51:27,313 --> 00:51:31,665
Why'd you say that back there?
We're friends, partners.

864
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:34,103
We're not partners
or friends.

865
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:37,628
This doesn't end with us
riding into the sunset.

866
00:51:37,671 --> 00:51:39,848
It ends with me
dying of cancer...

867
00:51:39,891 --> 00:51:43,765
and you winning the Ice Box
award for softest mouth.

868
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:46,811
There's only one person
in this world

869
00:51:46,855 --> 00:51:48,639
that I care about,
and she's gone.

870
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:53,600
You wanna survive?

871
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:56,952
Stop trying to shank
the biggest guys in here...

872
00:51:56,995 --> 00:51:58,867
and make friends with them.

873
00:52:00,172 --> 00:52:01,783
Make friends with someone.

874
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:04,611
Anyone but me.

875
00:52:05,787 --> 00:52:08,093
Maybe even Black Tim.

876
00:52:09,007 --> 00:52:10,617
Black Evan, I don't know.

877
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:13,142
All I remember is
he was African-American.

878
00:52:58,622 --> 00:53:00,711
<i>System malfunctioning.</i>

879
00:53:00,754 --> 00:53:04,106
<i>Cells 7, 12, 14, 27.</i>

880
00:53:04,149 --> 00:53:06,412
Back in your cells, you filthy
mutants! Get in there!

881
00:53:06,456 --> 00:53:09,763
<i>Cells 1, 3, 7, 8.</i>

882
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:12,379
<i>Searching.</i>

883
00:53:13,898 --> 00:53:16,248
<i>Cell 04 located.</i>

884
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:19,773
Door won't open!

885
00:53:19,817 --> 00:53:21,427
On your fucking knees!

886
00:53:58,377 --> 00:54:00,075
That was our cell.

887
00:54:02,207 --> 00:54:04,514
What did I do to piss off
a grumpy old fucker

888
00:54:04,557 --> 00:54:05,732
with a Winter Soldier arm?

889
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:16,918
Get away from me, kid!

890
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:25,752
Listen to me! Go!

891
00:54:31,236 --> 00:54:32,542
Hello, Russell.

892
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:17,125
Who are you?

893
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:19,257
I'm Batman.

894
00:56:30,703 --> 00:56:31,748
Ooh!

895
00:56:36,492 --> 00:56:39,364
Oh. That's got some zip.

896
00:56:47,894 --> 00:56:50,680
Don't feel bad.
Even I can't kill me.

897
00:56:51,376 --> 00:56:52,943
Talk!

898
00:56:52,986 --> 00:56:54,771
What kind of
spineless shit stick

899
00:56:54,814 --> 00:56:56,164
tries to kill
a 14-year-old boy?

900
00:56:57,469 --> 00:56:58,992
You might wanna start talking!

901
00:56:59,036 --> 00:57:01,276
'Cause I got a long history of
firing at times like this!

902
00:57:02,648 --> 00:57:04,650
The name's Cable.

903
00:57:04,694 --> 00:57:07,349
I'm from the future.
Just walk away.

904
00:57:08,045 --> 00:57:09,351
Oh!

905
00:57:09,394 --> 00:57:11,353
So, you're from the future.

906
00:57:11,396 --> 00:57:13,355
I have
three questions then.

907
00:57:13,398 --> 00:57:17,010
One, is dubstep still a thing?

908
00:57:17,054 --> 00:57:19,535
Two, do people still homebrew?

909
00:57:19,578 --> 00:57:22,146
And three,
does Dopinder ever find love?

910
00:58:06,321 --> 00:58:08,105
Dubstep's for pussies.

911
00:58:08,149 --> 00:58:09,454
You're so dark!

912
00:58:09,498 --> 00:58:11,587
Are you sure you're not
from the DC universe?

913
00:58:12,327 --> 00:58:13,893
I love dubstep!

914
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:41,617
Is that a fanny pack?

915
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,228
I used to have one of those
in 1990-never.

916
00:58:45,229 --> 00:58:47,318
Something to remember you by.

917
00:58:47,362 --> 00:58:51,148
Give me that back!
That goes with me everywhere.

918
00:58:51,192 --> 00:58:53,542
Like the memory
of your fucking fanny pack!

919
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,380
Why are you protecting
the kid?

920
00:59:06,685 --> 00:59:08,992
I don't give a fuck
about him...

921
00:59:09,035 --> 00:59:11,429
and his <i>Are You My Mother?</i>
complex!

922
00:59:13,779 --> 00:59:15,041
What's this one do?

923
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:30,840
<i>In every film,
there's a moment</i>

924
00:59:30,883 --> 00:59:33,277
<i>when the hero
hits rock bottom.</i>

925
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,279
<i>In Cool Runnings,
it was when John Candy's</i>

926
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:37,281
<i>prized bobsled broke.</i>

927
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:40,066
<i>In Human Centipede,
it was when those people...</i>

928
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,677
<i>signed on to be in that movie.</i>

929
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,853
<i>But in this film, well...</i>

930
00:59:43,896 --> 00:59:45,115
<i>you're looking at it.</i>

931
00:59:45,158 --> 00:59:46,899
On your fucking knees, mutant.

932
00:59:49,815 --> 00:59:50,816
<i>Rock...</i>

933
00:59:54,864 --> 00:59:56,344
<i>meet bottom.</i>

934
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,201
<i>I love you, Wade Wilson.</i>

935
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:09,400
Ness?

936
01:00:10,445 --> 01:00:11,924
Hey, Ness!

937
01:00:12,795 --> 01:00:14,623
Ness, can you let me in?

938
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:16,755
Please! Please.

939
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:20,063
Jesus.

940
01:00:22,979 --> 01:00:24,739
You're not giving me
a lot of direction here.

941
01:00:24,763 --> 01:00:26,591
I'm at the end of my rope.

942
01:00:29,072 --> 01:00:31,422
Then I joined the X-Men.

943
01:00:31,466 --> 01:00:33,294
I went to prison. I, uh...

944
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:38,908
Is it the kid?

945
01:00:40,953 --> 01:00:43,869
Kids give us a chance to be
better than we used to be.

946
01:00:45,306 --> 01:00:46,307
The kid!

947
01:00:59,929 --> 01:01:01,539
That's exactly what she meant.

948
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:02,995
Your heart needs to be
in the right place.

949
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:04,890
I'm not gonna
abandon this kid.

950
01:01:04,934 --> 01:01:07,545
He's never had anyone, ever.

951
01:01:07,589 --> 01:01:08,938
I need to be selfless.

952
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:10,940
Yeah, but what does
that mean?

953
01:01:10,983 --> 01:01:14,247
It means
I'm gonna save Russell.

954
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:15,814
Maybe I couldn't
save Vanessa...

955
01:01:15,858 --> 01:01:18,861
but maybe I can save a robust
teenager from New Zealand.

956
01:01:18,904 --> 01:01:20,969
Yeah, but what I mean is,
like, the world "selfless."

957
01:01:20,993 --> 01:01:22,517
I literally don't know
what that means.

958
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,735
Jesus Christ.

959
01:01:23,779 --> 01:01:26,521
Okay, look.
According to my guy, okay...

960
01:01:26,564 --> 01:01:28,392
those muties
are being transferred

961
01:01:28,436 --> 01:01:30,263
to a supermax, 80 miles away.

962
01:01:30,307 --> 01:01:32,135
Great, I'll pick 'em off
along the way.

963
01:01:32,178 --> 01:01:34,355
Hold your testicles there,
buddy, okay?

964
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:36,400
We're talking about
an armored convoy...

965
01:01:36,444 --> 01:01:39,055
and a vicious super soldier
from the future...

966
01:01:39,098 --> 01:01:41,449
that is looking to turn your
skull into a fuckable ashtray.

967
01:01:41,492 --> 01:01:42,972
You know what we need to do?

968
01:01:43,015 --> 01:01:44,887
We need to build
a fucking team.

969
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:47,019
We need 'em tough,
morally flexible...

970
01:01:47,063 --> 01:01:48,456
and young enough
so they can carry

971
01:01:48,499 --> 01:01:49,694
this franchise 10 to 12 years.

972
01:01:49,718 --> 01:01:51,589
A team of
highly-skilled motherfuckers.

973
01:01:51,633 --> 01:01:54,679
I'm talking about some
<i>Ocean's 14</i> shit. <i>Rogue Two.</i>

974
01:01:54,723 --> 01:01:57,160
<i>John Wick 3,</i> but with
the original director.

975
01:01:57,203 --> 01:01:59,118
My body is an
instrument of death.

976
01:01:59,162 --> 01:02:00,511
Not now, Dopinder.

977
01:02:00,555 --> 01:02:02,034
I could be of great use.

978
01:02:02,078 --> 01:02:03,645
What's your superpower?

979
01:02:05,473 --> 01:02:07,126
- Courage.
- That's adorable.

980
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,843
Do you have the courage
to check and see...

981
01:02:08,867 --> 01:02:11,261
if there are enough sanitary
napkins in the dispenser?

982
01:02:11,304 --> 01:02:12,349
Yes, sir.

983
01:02:12,393 --> 01:02:13,655
I'm sorry
you had to see that,

984
01:02:13,698 --> 01:02:16,048
although I'm glad
you heard it.

985
01:02:16,092 --> 01:02:18,007
All right, I'll put out
a call for resumes.

986
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:20,313
But we're not paying
medical or dental.

987
01:02:20,357 --> 01:02:22,403
It's time to get back
on LinkedIn.

988
01:02:59,265 --> 01:03:00,919
<i>Attention, all inmates!</i>

989
01:03:00,963 --> 01:03:03,400
<i>Transport to Cross Force
Maximum Security</i>

990
01:03:03,444 --> 01:03:04,923
<i>Mutant Containment Facility...</i>

991
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:06,925
<i>will begin at 0800 hours.</i>

992
01:03:06,969 --> 01:03:08,971
<i>Inspection of your cells
and out processing</i>

993
01:03:09,014 --> 01:03:11,060
<i>will begin at 0600.</i>

994
01:03:19,372 --> 01:03:20,461
Oi.

995
01:03:20,504 --> 01:03:21,853
What the fuck do you want?

996
01:03:21,897 --> 01:03:23,725
That's my fucking pudding.

997
01:03:23,768 --> 01:03:25,770
- Fuck your pudding!
- You like pudding?

998
01:03:46,791 --> 01:03:47,792
Hello?

999
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:52,449
I know you're in there.

1000
01:04:08,117 --> 01:04:10,423
Must be hard
being the biggest guy in here.

1001
01:04:11,686 --> 01:04:13,992
Lonely at the top, eh?

1002
01:04:14,036 --> 01:04:15,994
They're moving us tomorrow.

1003
01:04:18,475 --> 01:04:20,259
Maybe I can get you
out of here.

1004
01:04:21,478 --> 01:04:24,612
And we can make
the whole world our bitch.

1005
01:04:26,483 --> 01:04:28,224
We need a secret code.

1006
01:04:31,444 --> 01:04:33,882
No, that's stupid, Russell. Idiot.

1007
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:42,673
We're a team.

1008
01:04:42,717 --> 01:04:44,675
We're like thugs,
we're like gangsters.

1009
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:48,374
I'm like Tupac,
and you're like Ice Cube.

1010
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:49,526
Supposedly, she can rap, too.

1011
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:50,638
Yeah.

1012
01:04:50,681 --> 01:04:51,726
I like that.

1013
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:53,423
Terrific,
these are all terrific.

1014
01:04:53,466 --> 01:04:55,207
Meet Bedlam.

1015
01:04:55,251 --> 01:04:57,514
Cool name! Superpowers?

1016
01:04:57,558 --> 01:04:59,081
I can distort
electrical fields.

1017
01:05:00,299 --> 01:05:02,519
Including the one
inside your brain...

1018
01:05:02,563 --> 01:05:05,261
causing anxiety, confusion...

1019
01:05:05,304 --> 01:05:07,306
pain.

1020
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:09,439
So, basically,
you're Dave Matthews.

1021
01:05:09,482 --> 01:05:10,614
We can use him.

1022
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:14,052
I'm Zeitgeist.

1023
01:05:14,096 --> 01:05:15,401
Cool. I like it.

1024
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:16,707
So you have the power

1025
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:19,101
to put your finger
on the pulse of society?

1026
01:05:20,145 --> 01:05:21,320
No.

1027
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:22,931
No, I spit acidic vomit.

1028
01:05:22,974 --> 01:05:24,106
- Oh.
- Do you want me

1029
01:05:24,149 --> 01:05:25,542
- to demonstrate?
- No!

1030
01:05:25,586 --> 01:05:27,065
We'll take your word for it.

1031
01:05:27,109 --> 01:05:29,261
Thank you. Yeah. Listen,
we've all eaten at Arby's, okay?

1032
01:05:29,285 --> 01:05:31,896
And this is the Vanisher.

1033
01:05:35,247 --> 01:05:36,248
But...

1034
01:05:37,423 --> 01:05:38,903
Vanisher!

1035
01:05:41,427 --> 01:05:43,081
- Nice!
- Right?

1036
01:05:44,387 --> 01:05:45,518
He's not here, is he?

1037
01:05:45,562 --> 01:05:47,085
He may be running late.

1038
01:05:48,696 --> 01:05:51,524
My name's Rusty,
but I go by Shatterstar.

1039
01:05:51,568 --> 01:05:52,787
<b>BOTH:</b> That's good, yeah.

1040
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:54,963
- "Rusty" is terrible.
- Toughie.

1041
01:05:55,006 --> 01:05:57,835
- So, uh, where are you from?
- The planet Mojo World.

1042
01:05:57,879 --> 01:05:59,924
- So you're an alien, I guess.
- Bad name.

1043
01:05:59,968 --> 01:06:01,665
How does that, uh, help us?

1044
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:04,625
I'm basically better
than you at everything.

1045
01:06:04,668 --> 01:06:06,385
Just once, I'm gonna find
a planet of people

1046
01:06:06,409 --> 01:06:07,976
that are worse than me
at everything.

1047
01:06:08,019 --> 01:06:10,239
A whole bunch
of functional idiots.

1048
01:06:10,282 --> 01:06:12,217
I'm gonna go there, and I'm
gonna be their Superman.

1049
01:06:12,241 --> 01:06:13,372
Isn't that Canada?

1050
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:15,810
You shut your
goddamn trash mouth!

1051
01:06:16,985 --> 01:06:18,508
- Meet...
- Domino.

1052
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:20,597
- What's your shtick?
- I'm lucky.

1053
01:06:20,641 --> 01:06:22,033
That's not a superpower.

1054
01:06:22,077 --> 01:06:23,208
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it isn't.

1055
01:06:23,252 --> 01:06:24,514
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

1056
01:06:24,557 --> 01:06:25,602
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it isn't.

1057
01:06:25,646 --> 01:06:26,690
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

1058
01:06:26,734 --> 01:06:27,754
- Yeah, it is.
- Really isn't.

1059
01:06:27,778 --> 01:06:28,997
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

1060
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,215
Told you.

1061
01:06:30,259 --> 01:06:31,608
Get out of my head!

1062
01:06:31,652 --> 01:06:33,262
I'm not in your head.

1063
01:06:33,305 --> 01:06:34,655
I'm in an
11-year-old's bedroom.

1064
01:06:34,698 --> 01:06:35,830
Well, if you're so lucky,

1065
01:06:35,873 --> 01:06:37,483
then what are you
doing here with us?

1066
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:38,659
I don't know yet.

1067
01:06:38,702 --> 01:06:40,225
What's that supposed to mean?

1068
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:41,550
There's a reason why I'm here,
and I'll know when I know.

1069
01:06:41,574 --> 01:06:43,378
Everything usually
just kind of works out for me.

1070
01:06:43,402 --> 01:06:45,230
Like 2008 Ryan Reynolds.

1071
01:06:46,536 --> 01:06:47,668
I don't know who that is.

1072
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:49,191
You're hired.

1073
01:06:49,234 --> 01:06:50,279
Lucky me.

1074
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:51,541
I like her!

1075
01:06:52,673 --> 01:06:53,978
And last, but not least...

1076
01:06:54,022 --> 01:06:55,153
Peter.

1077
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:59,070
Am I getting
catfished here or...?

1078
01:06:59,114 --> 01:07:01,029
Any powers you wanna
tell us about?

1079
01:07:01,072 --> 01:07:02,683
No.

1080
01:07:02,726 --> 01:07:04,423
I don't have one.

1081
01:07:04,467 --> 01:07:05,773
Um, I just saw the ad.

1082
01:07:05,816 --> 01:07:07,600
No superpowers at all?

1083
01:07:07,644 --> 01:07:10,734
Uh, I have both
Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.

1084
01:07:11,256 --> 01:07:12,605
Ow! Oh!

1085
01:07:12,649 --> 01:07:13,781
That's all the diabetes.

1086
01:07:13,824 --> 01:07:15,130
Right?
Yeah, you got 'em all.

1087
01:07:15,173 --> 01:07:17,088
If you find a Type 3,
let us know.

1088
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:18,655
Yeah.

1089
01:07:18,699 --> 01:07:19,787
You're in.

1090
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:21,353
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

1091
01:07:23,747 --> 01:07:25,140
It's fulfilling work.

1092
01:07:30,232 --> 01:07:31,537
Let's go!

1093
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,771
<i>This is Convoy 17
departing the Ice Box.</i>

1094
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:49,164
<i>We are en route.</i>

1095
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:59,130
Peacetime makes people soft.

1096
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:02,525
I was born into war.

1097
01:08:04,048 --> 01:08:05,223
Bred into it.

1098
01:08:06,355 --> 01:08:08,139
Okay.

1099
01:08:08,183 --> 01:08:10,533
What's the most pain
you've ever felt?

1100
01:08:12,491 --> 01:08:13,754
These restraints are pretty...

1101
01:08:13,797 --> 01:08:15,668
People think
they understand pain.

1102
01:08:15,712 --> 01:08:17,148
They have no concept of it

1103
01:08:17,192 --> 01:08:19,150
beyond their own
worst experience.

1104
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:23,938
5 years old. That's what?

1105
01:08:23,981 --> 01:08:25,548
A bee sting.

1106
01:08:25,591 --> 01:08:26,723
Oh, yeah.

1107
01:08:26,767 --> 01:08:29,291
20 years old, shrapnel.

1108
01:08:29,334 --> 01:08:32,033
40 years old, disease.

1109
01:08:32,076 --> 01:08:36,646
Maybe the kind that leaves you
more machine than man.

1110
01:08:36,689 --> 01:08:38,089
Yeah, getting old's
not for sissies.

1111
01:08:38,126 --> 01:08:39,780
That's what my
Grandma Ginny used to...

1112
01:08:39,823 --> 01:08:40,998
I've got a list.

1113
01:08:41,782 --> 01:08:43,740
We're gonna work down it.

1114
01:08:44,436 --> 01:08:45,437
Together.

1115
01:08:46,612 --> 01:08:49,659
Number one,
I'm gonna bend something.

1116
01:08:49,702 --> 01:08:52,009
Something that was not
meant to bend.

1117
01:08:52,053 --> 01:08:53,204
I'm gonna
stop you right there

1118
01:08:53,228 --> 01:08:54,553
because I'm not gonna
make it to two.

1119
01:08:54,577 --> 01:08:55,883
I won't even
make it to one.

1120
01:08:55,926 --> 01:08:57,667
I don't do well with pain,
you know.

1121
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:00,061
If I stub my toe,
I'm done for the day.

1122
01:09:00,104 --> 01:09:02,498
I cried when they
canceled <i>Felicity.</i>

1123
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,389
When I get really scared,
I get nervous erections.

1124
01:09:04,413 --> 01:09:05,806
I have one right now.

1125
01:09:05,849 --> 01:09:07,416
Don't look.
It'll only make it worse.

1126
01:09:07,459 --> 01:09:08,591
I don't want you
to hurt me,

1127
01:09:08,634 --> 01:09:10,811
and I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

1128
01:09:11,812 --> 01:09:13,944
Except for where they are.

1129
01:09:13,988 --> 01:09:15,269
Russell's in a convoy
heading southbound

1130
01:09:15,293 --> 01:09:16,686
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.

1131
01:09:16,729 --> 01:09:18,055
The monster's with them.
I wouldn't fuck with him.

1132
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:19,558
You all know the plan.

1133
01:09:19,602 --> 01:09:21,343
Intercept the convoy,

1134
01:09:21,386 --> 01:09:23,388
grab the boy.
But not inappropriately!

1135
01:09:23,432 --> 01:09:24,781
<i>You know what,</i>

1136
01:09:24,825 --> 01:09:26,348
<i>I wouldn't fuck with
Deadpool either.</i>

1137
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:28,524
<i>Because he's built a team.
He's unstoppable.</i>

1138
01:09:28,567 --> 01:09:31,266
He has an ass pen.
He'll stab you with it.

1139
01:09:31,309 --> 01:09:33,921
Watch out for this guy, Cable!

1140
01:09:33,964 --> 01:09:37,228
He's very short, 5'11".
Not like in the comics.

1141
01:09:37,272 --> 01:09:40,362
And if we succeed,
we all go home early.

1142
01:09:40,405 --> 01:09:42,485
So if you go after
them, Cable, I warn you...

1143
01:09:43,278 --> 01:09:44,975
there's a wind advisory
in effect.

1144
01:09:56,117 --> 01:09:57,757
<i>A little turbulent up here.</i>

1145
01:10:05,126 --> 01:10:06,910
I don't know much
about this Cable fella...

1146
01:10:06,954 --> 01:10:08,346
but I guarantee
he hasn't killed

1147
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:10,131
as many people
as melanoma has.

1148
01:10:11,523 --> 01:10:12,916
We're getting close!

1149
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,657
As a former X-Man...

1150
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,615
- Trainee.
- Thank you, Bedlam.

1151
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:19,009
I was always appalled
by the blatant sexism

1152
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:20,663
in the group's name.

1153
01:10:20,706 --> 01:10:22,752
X-Men! Men!

1154
01:10:22,795 --> 01:10:25,798
The point is, our group
will be forward thinking.

1155
01:10:25,842 --> 01:10:27,148
Gender neutral.

1156
01:10:27,191 --> 01:10:29,498
From now on,
we'll be known as...

1157
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:33,110
X-Force.

1158
01:10:33,154 --> 01:10:34,938
Isn't that
a little derivative?

1159
01:10:34,982 --> 01:10:37,375
I don't recall asking
your opinion, Peter!

1160
01:10:38,637 --> 01:10:40,074
That wasn't me.

1161
01:10:47,124 --> 01:10:49,474
Hang the laundry out
at 1,300 feet...

1162
01:10:49,518 --> 01:10:51,346
intercept the convoy,
and grab the boy.

1163
01:10:51,389 --> 01:10:52,497
Let's bring on
the carnage, baby!

1164
01:10:52,521 --> 01:10:54,392
Get me on the ground,
watch me go!

1165
01:10:54,436 --> 01:10:55,567
Yeah!

1166
01:10:55,611 --> 01:10:57,308
I can't wait to kill!

1167
01:10:57,352 --> 01:11:00,094
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1168
01:11:00,137 --> 01:11:02,835
I just wanna say
how proud I am of this team.

1169
01:11:02,879 --> 01:11:05,751
You know,
you guys look amazing!

1170
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:08,667
Vanisher, I have no doubt
you look amazing too.

1171
01:11:08,711 --> 01:11:09,842
This is the family

1172
01:11:09,886 --> 01:11:11,566
that I've always dreamed
of having and I...

1173
01:11:12,323 --> 01:11:13,411
Ah, shit.

1174
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:16,719
I just get a little choked up
sometimes.

1175
01:11:16,762 --> 01:11:18,590
I hate to interrupt,
but is anybody nervous

1176
01:11:18,634 --> 01:11:19,983
about the high winds?

1177
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:21,376
- Gary.
- My name's Peter.

1178
01:11:21,419 --> 01:11:23,334
I realize that you're
new to this, but relax.

1179
01:11:23,378 --> 01:11:25,032
You've been chosen
by a higher power.

1180
01:11:25,075 --> 01:11:27,382
- Did he just call himself God?
- I think he did.

1181
01:11:27,425 --> 01:11:28,992
- I'd like to go home.
- And I'd like...

1182
01:11:29,036 --> 01:11:31,560
the McRib to be available
year round,

1183
01:11:31,603 --> 01:11:33,431
but sometimes dreams
don't come true.

1184
01:11:33,475 --> 01:11:35,651
I spent 10 years
in Special Forces.

1185
01:11:35,694 --> 01:11:36,845
You think we didn't
jump out of the plane

1186
01:11:36,869 --> 01:11:38,828
because of a light breeze?

1187
01:11:38,871 --> 01:11:41,135
You're in this shit now,
Mustache!

1188
01:11:41,178 --> 01:11:43,156
I'm only yelling
to impress the other guys.

1189
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:45,487
I'd never let anything
happen to you, Sugarbear.

1190
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:47,750
Leonard, hit it!

1191
01:11:56,454 --> 01:11:58,500
Go! Go! Go!

1192
01:12:34,188 --> 01:12:35,624
Let's get some!

1193
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:36,842
Whoo!

1194
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:38,061
Oh, yeah!

1195
01:12:38,105 --> 01:12:40,933
Convoy, 12 o'clock!
On my command!

1196
01:12:41,978 --> 01:12:43,458
Deploy! Oh, hey now!

1197
01:12:43,501 --> 01:12:44,763
Whoa!

1198
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:51,944
Little off course here.

1199
01:12:54,121 --> 01:12:56,949
Holy mommy fucking shit!

1200
01:12:57,689 --> 01:12:59,126
Ah, there they are.

1201
01:12:59,169 --> 01:13:02,781
Look at these gorgeous
sons of bitches.

1202
01:13:02,825 --> 01:13:04,740
Oh, yeah!
That's right, Bedlam!

1203
01:13:09,832 --> 01:13:14,097
No! Tripping
motherfucking billies!

1204
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:17,231
Shatterstar.
Okay, you got this.

1205
01:13:18,014 --> 01:13:19,059
Left!

1206
01:13:19,102 --> 01:13:20,451
Left!

1207
01:13:20,495 --> 01:13:22,758
You'd have to be insane
to take off in this.

1208
01:13:22,801 --> 01:13:25,021
No, stage left, you idiot!

1209
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:30,461
Well, I guess
we found something

1210
01:13:30,505 --> 01:13:31,593
you're not better at.

1211
01:13:33,812 --> 01:13:35,118
Vanisher.

1212
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:36,946
Maybe the wind can't blow
what it can't see.

1213
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,516
Oh! Really?

1214
01:13:41,559 --> 01:13:43,909
All right,
we could do this with four.

1215
01:13:43,953 --> 01:13:46,956
Sugarbear.
You got this, buddy!

1216
01:13:46,999 --> 01:13:49,089
That's the stuff!
That's the X-Force spirit!

1217
01:13:50,307 --> 01:13:52,396
Never underestimate
a man with a mustache!

1218
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,006
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.

1219
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:55,225
We did it!

1220
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:56,835
You're a goddamn
superhero, you!

1221
01:13:56,879 --> 01:13:57,967
X-Force!

1222
01:13:58,576 --> 01:13:59,664
X-Force.

1223
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,931
Oh!

1224
01:14:09,631 --> 01:14:10,675
Peter.

1225
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:12,024
I got you, buddy!

1226
01:14:12,068 --> 01:14:13,263
- You're gonna be fine!
- This is not good, man!

1227
01:14:13,287 --> 01:14:15,593
You got this, big guy!
Here we go, Peter!

1228
01:14:15,637 --> 01:14:17,117
Look at me.
We're X-Force, right?

1229
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,249
- Yeah, we're X-Force.
- We're X-Force.

1230
01:14:23,297 --> 01:14:25,342
Oh, my God!
What the fuck?

1231
01:14:25,386 --> 01:14:27,388
Fucking acidic vomit!

1232
01:14:28,954 --> 01:14:31,740
Oh, God! I'm gonna throw up
in my mask.

1233
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:37,224
Okay, I'm over the convoy.

1234
01:14:37,267 --> 01:14:39,704
Where did the rest
of the team land?

1235
01:14:39,748 --> 01:14:41,402
Good news and bad news.

1236
01:14:41,445 --> 01:14:44,579
Bad news is
the whole team is dead.

1237
01:14:44,622 --> 01:14:45,928
The good news is,

1238
01:14:45,971 --> 01:14:47,799
I don't think anyone's
gonna miss Shatterstar.

1239
01:14:47,843 --> 01:14:51,194
He was a bit of a prick.
Oh, but Paul!

1240
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:52,239
<i>Peter!</i>

1241
01:14:52,282 --> 01:14:53,762
Peter, I'm gonna
miss him most.

1242
01:14:53,805 --> 01:14:54,937
But there is
a slight chance

1243
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,330
Vanisher could make it.

1244
01:14:56,373 --> 01:14:58,984
Nope, no chance. He's dead.

1245
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:00,203
<i>The whole team?</i>

1246
01:15:00,247 --> 01:15:02,118
Only the main ones.
We're still good.

1247
01:15:02,162 --> 01:15:03,424
<i>Fuck, you are dumb.</i>

1248
01:15:03,467 --> 01:15:05,121
Whoever planned this stunt's

1249
01:15:05,165 --> 01:15:07,341
been smoking
a lot jazz cabbage.

1250
01:15:07,384 --> 01:15:08,516
I'll tell you that much.

1251
01:15:08,559 --> 01:15:10,213
That's pretty obvious!

1252
01:15:10,257 --> 01:15:11,997
- Looking good, Vanisher.
- Hey!

1253
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:23,705
They're headed
into the tunnel.

1254
01:15:24,706 --> 01:15:26,186
I'm that kid's only hope,

1255
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:28,100
so sit tight
and wait for my word.

1256
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,146
<i>Whatever.</i>

1257
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:31,713
<i>We're gonna lose 'em.
I'm dropping in.</i>

1258
01:15:31,756 --> 01:15:34,150
<i>Uh, that's a negative,
sole survivor.</i>

1259
01:15:34,194 --> 01:15:36,718
<i>Luck is not a superpower!
We are so fucked!</i>

1260
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:39,851
No, we most certainly
are not fucked.

1261
01:15:42,941 --> 01:15:45,596
<i>Seriously, I don't get it!</i>

1262
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:48,120
<i>What, you shoot luck lasers
out of your eyes?</i>

1263
01:15:50,297 --> 01:15:52,124
<i>It's just
it's hard to picture.</i>

1264
01:15:52,168 --> 01:15:54,257
<i>And certainly
not very cinematic.</i>

1265
01:15:56,955 --> 01:15:58,566
<i>I mean, luck?</i>

1266
01:15:58,609 --> 01:16:01,177
<i>What coked out,
glass pipe-sucking</i>

1267
01:16:01,221 --> 01:16:02,570
<i>freakshow comic book artist...</i>

1268
01:16:02,613 --> 01:16:04,267
<i>came up
with that little chestnut?</i>

1269
01:16:04,311 --> 01:16:06,574
<i>Probably a guy
who can't draw feet!</i>

1270
01:16:17,672 --> 01:16:20,979
<i>Once again, it all falls
on my shoulders.</i>

1271
01:16:21,023 --> 01:16:22,261
<i>It's why I'm cursed to be
a solo act.</i>

1272
01:16:22,285 --> 01:16:23,306
- <i>Wander the Earth...</i>
- I'm in.

1273
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:24,853
<i>I'm sorry, what did you say?</i>

1274
01:16:24,896 --> 01:16:26,028
<i>I'm in.</i>

1275
01:16:26,071 --> 01:16:27,943
How in the fuck
are you in already?

1276
01:16:28,378 --> 01:16:30,206
Oh, shit.

1277
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,468
It's Cable. 12 o'clock.

1278
01:16:31,512 --> 01:16:32,643
<i>Okay.</i>

1279
01:16:32,687 --> 01:16:35,124
New plan. Use all of your
imaginary powers

1280
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:37,909
to stop Cable
from killing that kid.

1281
01:16:37,953 --> 01:16:39,563
I'm coming up on your six.

1282
01:16:47,832 --> 01:16:49,878
That gun is amazing!

1283
01:16:59,017 --> 01:17:01,063
Hey! Asshole!

1284
01:17:01,106 --> 01:17:02,717
<i>Where is he?
I can't see him.</i>

1285
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,501
<i>He's on top of you.</i>

1286
01:17:04,545 --> 01:17:06,416
<i>He's tearing you open!</i>

1287
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,375
<i>He's going in
through the back!</i>

1288
01:17:08,418 --> 01:17:09,550
<i>Oh, God, he's inside!</i>

1289
01:17:09,593 --> 01:17:10,899
You hear yourself, right?

1290
01:17:10,942 --> 01:17:12,398
<i>Accidental double entendres!</i>

1291
01:17:12,422 --> 01:17:14,946
Russell! Russell Collins!

1292
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:16,905
Hands off that kid,
John Connor!

1293
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:22,911
No, no, no!

1294
01:17:27,263 --> 01:17:28,351
Shit!

1295
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:52,244
Two can play that game!

1296
01:17:54,377 --> 01:17:56,205
Got it! No, I don't.

1297
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:58,250
<i>Showtime, mama!</i>

1298
01:17:58,294 --> 01:17:59,904
Lady Luck, take the wheel.

1299
01:18:37,725 --> 01:18:39,529
I'd ask who you are,
but you'll be dead in a second.

1300
01:18:39,553 --> 01:18:41,642
I'm Domino, and doubtful.

1301
01:18:58,223 --> 01:18:59,224
Hang in there, Doms!

1302
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:02,227
Oh, this is really hard.

1303
01:19:14,501 --> 01:19:15,901
And give me back
my Skee-Ball token.

1304
01:19:19,419 --> 01:19:20,942
- You're doing great.
- X-Force.

1305
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,946
I guess dubstep never dies.

1306
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:30,255
Whoo!

1307
01:19:37,262 --> 01:19:39,917
You killed Black Tom,
you racist son of a bitch!

1308
01:19:42,703 --> 01:19:43,834
That's unfortunate.

1309
01:19:46,968 --> 01:19:48,360
We got no brakes!

1310
01:19:48,404 --> 01:19:49,623
Figure it out!

1311
01:19:54,018 --> 01:19:55,542
There's nothing I can't kill.

1312
01:19:58,370 --> 01:20:00,895
Well, as Scoutmaster Kevin
used to say...

1313
01:20:00,938 --> 01:20:03,288
"There's a first time
for everything, son."

1314
01:20:04,986 --> 01:20:06,553
Give me your best shot,
One-Eyed Willy.

1315
01:20:21,437 --> 01:20:23,352
Those bullets were, like,
super fast.

1316
01:20:23,918 --> 01:20:24,919
Here we go.

1317
01:20:26,007 --> 01:20:28,270
Domino, mind slowing us down?

1318
01:20:28,313 --> 01:20:30,446
Here goes nothing.

1319
01:21:01,608 --> 01:21:03,348
Knock, knock.

1320
01:21:09,877 --> 01:21:10,921
That's my boy.

1321
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:18,538
Holy...

1322
01:21:28,765 --> 01:21:30,419
<i>I'll be first to admit...</i>

1323
01:21:30,462 --> 01:21:32,813
<i>this did not go
according to plan.</i>

1324
01:21:34,162 --> 01:21:35,729
<i>I'll also be the first
to admit that</i>

1325
01:21:35,772 --> 01:21:37,644
<i>that plan was
written in crayon.</i>

1326
01:21:37,687 --> 01:21:40,951
<i>Looks like Russell found
a new friend. Jelly.</i>

1327
01:21:40,995 --> 01:21:42,605
<i>Turns out Domino's
a bit of a badass,</i>

1328
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:45,565
<i>and maybe,
possibly mildly lucky.</i>

1329
01:21:45,608 --> 01:21:48,872
<i>But Cable? Ugh.
That guy's in a mood.</i>

1330
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:50,134
A mood that is

1331
01:21:50,178 --> 01:21:51,962
about to get
significantly worse.

1332
01:22:15,725 --> 01:22:18,162
Something is so terribly,
terribly wrong.

1333
01:22:21,122 --> 01:22:22,602
Oh.

1334
01:22:24,386 --> 01:22:26,040
Oh, God, that hurt.

1335
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:27,694
Suck it, Mel Gibson.

1336
01:22:31,262 --> 01:22:32,350
Russell.

1337
01:22:35,049 --> 01:22:36,137
Russell!

1338
01:22:36,746 --> 01:22:38,835
Russ, where are ya?

1339
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:44,667
Russell. Russell, you're okay!

1340
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:48,149
Oh, thank God.
Oh, my God!

1341
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,541
Juggernaut!

1342
01:22:50,717 --> 01:22:52,762
I thought that was you!

1343
01:22:52,806 --> 01:22:55,635
I should've worn
my white pants.

1344
01:22:55,678 --> 01:22:59,508
You probably get this a lot,
but I am a huge fan.

1345
01:22:59,551 --> 01:23:02,859
<i>Uncanny X-Men</i> 183. <i>Thor</i> 411.

1346
01:23:02,903 --> 01:23:04,252
<i>X-Men Unlimited</i> 12.

1347
01:23:04,295 --> 01:23:06,428
You know, it has always been
a dream of mine...

1348
01:23:06,471 --> 01:23:08,256
to see my face
reflected in your helmet...

1349
01:23:08,299 --> 01:23:10,519
as you charge at me
with murderous intent.

1350
01:23:10,562 --> 01:23:12,347
I don't mean right now.

1351
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:14,305
I'm gonna rip you
in half now.

1352
01:23:14,349 --> 01:23:16,699
That is such
a Juggernaut thing to say.

1353
01:23:20,747 --> 01:23:24,794
Oh, my God!
I can't feel my legs.

1354
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:25,926
I can't feel...

1355
01:23:26,883 --> 01:23:28,406
Oh, no, they're right here.

1356
01:23:29,233 --> 01:23:31,018
Got 'em.
God, Russell.

1357
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:33,411
I have a mission.

1358
01:23:33,455 --> 01:23:35,022
To get my revenge.

1359
01:23:35,065 --> 01:23:37,372
I'm going to burn
that headmaster alive.

1360
01:23:37,415 --> 01:23:39,635
You're not the revenge type.

1361
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,202
Take it from a friend.

1362
01:23:41,245 --> 01:23:45,075
Friend? You were sick,
and I protected you.

1363
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:47,295
You said it yourself.

1364
01:23:47,338 --> 01:23:50,037
"I'm not your friend.
Find someone stronger."

1365
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,516
So I did.

1366
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,216
Russell, I couldn't
protect you back then.

1367
01:23:55,259 --> 01:23:59,263
But I can now. What do you
want me to say, huh?

1368
01:23:59,307 --> 01:24:01,178
"I care about you"?
'Cause goddamn it,

1369
01:24:01,222 --> 01:24:03,659
I care about you, Russell.

1370
01:24:03,703 --> 01:24:05,792
What's Juggernaut got
that I don't have?

1371
01:24:05,835 --> 01:24:09,534
Don't you say legs!
I know you're gonna say legs!

1372
01:24:09,578 --> 01:24:12,363
- Legs!
- Still hurts to hear out loud!

1373
01:24:14,539 --> 01:24:17,499
What is that?
That's not a real rope!

1374
01:24:17,542 --> 01:24:19,849
You get back here, young man!

1375
01:24:20,807 --> 01:24:22,286
Doms!

1376
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:24,549
Doms, get me
out of here, please.

1377
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:26,987
Use my arms
as backpack straps.

1378
01:24:29,729 --> 01:24:30,817
I think we may have found

1379
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:33,036
your cosmic reason
for being here.

1380
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,864
I'm pretty sure
this isn't it.

1381
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:36,170
X-Force.

1382
01:24:49,705 --> 01:24:51,533
<i>No child is hopeless.</i>

1383
01:24:51,576 --> 01:24:55,058
- Don't give up on the boy.
- How could he just walk away?

1384
01:24:55,102 --> 01:24:57,800
It was the coldness
in his eyes.

1385
01:24:57,844 --> 01:24:59,410
You should've heard it.

1386
01:25:01,325 --> 01:25:03,632
I guess family
really is an F-word.

1387
01:25:04,546 --> 01:25:06,766
Rub my legs, Mama.

1388
01:25:06,809 --> 01:25:08,202
Why would I
rub your legs?

1389
01:25:08,245 --> 01:25:11,161
Please, they hurt.
I have growing pains.

1390
01:25:14,295 --> 01:25:15,949
What in the...

1391
01:25:15,992 --> 01:25:18,734
Why is your hand
so tiny again?

1392
01:25:18,778 --> 01:25:20,605
That's not my hand.

1393
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:22,999
Oh! Mary,
mother of Joseph!

1394
01:25:23,043 --> 01:25:24,958
That was nice for me.

1395
01:25:25,001 --> 01:25:27,830
Wade! I heard what happened
with the convoy and...

1396
01:25:32,269 --> 01:25:34,576
Why wouldn't you
cover that up?

1397
01:25:34,619 --> 01:25:36,839
A warrior has nothing
to be ashamed of.

1398
01:25:36,883 --> 01:25:38,841
Yeah, but you do.
Look at you.

1399
01:25:38,885 --> 01:25:40,887
You're just
straight shirt-cocking it,

1400
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:42,410
toddler-style.

1401
01:25:42,453 --> 01:25:44,412
Oh, yeah.
Full Winnie the Pooh.

1402
01:25:44,455 --> 01:25:46,457
The hell's happening?
Describe it.

1403
01:25:46,501 --> 01:25:47,783
I wouldn't ask him to do that,
if I were you.

1404
01:25:47,807 --> 01:25:49,417
- It's like, um...
- Here we go.

1405
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:50,742
It's like he was
giving birth anally,

1406
01:25:50,766 --> 01:25:52,289
but they quit halfway through.

1407
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:53,484
They got the legs out,
and they said,

1408
01:25:53,508 --> 01:25:54,857
"You know what, I'm done."

1409
01:25:54,901 --> 01:25:56,163
Happy?

1410
01:25:56,206 --> 01:25:57,314
It's like he's a Muppet
from the waist down.

1411
01:25:57,338 --> 01:25:58,513
But this time, you can see

1412
01:25:58,556 --> 01:25:59,993
the Muppet's dick.

1413
01:26:00,036 --> 01:26:01,559
Grover's got a cock
the size of a twig.

1414
01:26:01,603 --> 01:26:02,798
Mr. Weasel, I can
no longer be double-parked.

1415
01:26:02,822 --> 01:26:04,422
I've had three tickets already.

1416
01:26:05,912 --> 01:26:08,697
No, no, no, DP,
not again!

1417
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:11,352
This has happened before?

1418
01:26:11,395 --> 01:26:12,895
Jesus! Either vomit or don't.

1419
01:26:12,919 --> 01:26:14,224
The indecision is killing me.

1420
01:26:14,268 --> 01:26:16,139
Why couldn't God
take my hearing?

1421
01:26:17,749 --> 01:26:19,926
Oh. Wow!

1422
01:26:19,969 --> 01:26:21,666
Cool your pits.
They're growing back.

1423
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,668
I'm talking about your face.

1424
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:25,627
I've never seen you
without your mask before.

1425
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:27,890
- Jesus Christ!
- Looks like an avocado.

1426
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:29,849
Your legs, though,
they're cute.

1427
01:26:29,892 --> 01:26:31,676
You wanna borrow
a pair of pants?

1428
01:26:33,243 --> 01:26:34,854
I'm glad everybody dropped by.

1429
01:26:34,897 --> 01:26:37,595
You must be wondering
why I didn't call you here.

1430
01:26:37,639 --> 01:26:39,249
I'll tell you why I'm here.

1431
01:26:39,293 --> 01:26:41,643
"The Time Traveler's Wife's"
husband...

1432
01:26:41,686 --> 01:26:42,925
beat me within
an inch of my life.

1433
01:26:42,949 --> 01:26:44,298
He was torturing me!

1434
01:26:44,341 --> 01:26:47,214
But all I told him was
everything he wanted to know.

1435
01:26:47,257 --> 01:26:49,912
So, I'm here
to help us gear up.

1436
01:26:49,956 --> 01:26:51,107
So we can go after him
without me.

1437
01:26:51,131 --> 01:26:52,523
No!

1438
01:26:52,567 --> 01:26:53,916
I'm doing this alone.

1439
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,091
The Juggernaut

1440
01:26:55,135 --> 01:26:56,571
- will kill you all.
- Fair enough.

1441
01:26:56,614 --> 01:26:58,505
I just need a couple of
hours to get some legs

1442
01:26:58,529 --> 01:26:59,661
- under me.
- What will you do?

1443
01:26:59,704 --> 01:27:01,030
I don't care
what the kid did to me.

1444
01:27:01,054 --> 01:27:02,403
I ain't letting Cable
get to him,

1445
01:27:02,446 --> 01:27:03,815
even if I have to
teabag him to death.

1446
01:27:03,839 --> 01:27:05,885
It's really just a sip of tea
at this point.

1447
01:27:05,928 --> 01:27:07,712
Zip it, black Black Widow!
I'm flowing.

1448
01:27:07,756 --> 01:27:08,820
The first order
of business is

1449
01:27:08,844 --> 01:27:10,237
to get me in front of Cable...

1450
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,692
so I can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body...

1451
01:27:11,716 --> 01:27:14,067
and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.

1452
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:15,938
Then,
I'm gonna take his skin...

1453
01:27:15,982 --> 01:27:19,028
and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum.

1454
01:27:20,638 --> 01:27:22,238
He's standing right
behind you, isn't he?

1455
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:32,912
What in the ass?

1456
01:27:32,955 --> 01:27:36,263
Is this apartment listed
on Tinder? Grindr?

1457
01:27:36,306 --> 01:27:39,353
You picked the wrong shithole
to fuck, future boy.

1458
01:27:39,396 --> 01:27:41,921
Ugh. Is that really necessary?

1459
01:27:44,184 --> 01:27:46,969
No. It's his
"Basic Instinct."

1460
01:27:47,013 --> 01:27:48,753
What can we help you with?

1461
01:27:48,797 --> 01:27:50,451
I'm here to proposition you.

1462
01:27:51,974 --> 01:27:53,062
Oh, boy!

1463
01:27:53,106 --> 01:27:54,170
He's really teeing it up,
isn't he?

1464
01:27:54,194 --> 01:27:56,326
Who gets to make
the first joke?

1465
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:57,738
I think we should all do it
at the same time.

1466
01:27:57,762 --> 01:27:58,807
Good call.

1467
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:00,417
For $45, you get sucky-suck.

1468
01:28:00,461 --> 01:28:01,699
I only do over the pants,
mouth stuff.

1469
01:28:01,723 --> 01:28:02,854
Fuck!

1470
01:28:02,898 --> 01:28:04,006
<i>The Proposition</i>
has a wonderful

1471
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:05,335
Guy Pearce performance.

1472
01:28:05,379 --> 01:28:07,139
Wait, wait, wait!
I wanna do mine over.

1473
01:28:07,163 --> 01:28:09,774
- Give us the line again.
- I need your help!

1474
01:28:09,818 --> 01:28:12,125
Trust me, I'm even less happy
about this than you are...

1475
01:28:12,168 --> 01:28:15,302
but you unleashed
the Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!

1476
01:28:15,345 --> 01:28:17,739
I can't bring him down alone.

1477
01:28:17,782 --> 01:28:19,306
So here we are.

1478
01:28:20,655 --> 01:28:22,439
We're no longer
accepting applications

1479
01:28:22,483 --> 01:28:23,919
for X-Force, unfortunately.

1480
01:28:23,963 --> 01:28:25,399
Even if we were...

1481
01:28:25,442 --> 01:28:27,116
there's a wind advisory
in effect until at least...

1482
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:28,402
We don't have a lot of time.

1483
01:28:28,445 --> 01:28:30,186
Your friend's about
to make his first kill.

1484
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:31,753
No offense,
but if you know so much...

1485
01:28:31,796 --> 01:28:34,669
why not travel back to when
he was a baby, kill him then?

1486
01:28:34,712 --> 01:28:35,776
Or better yet, head back
a little further,

1487
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,888
kill baby Hitler.

1488
01:28:36,932 --> 01:28:38,890
I use a device
to slide through time.

1489
01:28:38,934 --> 01:28:41,589
The longer I travel,
the harder it is to control.

1490
01:28:41,632 --> 01:28:44,244
I got two charges:
one to get me here,

1491
01:28:44,287 --> 01:28:45,462
one to get me home.

1492
01:28:45,506 --> 01:28:46,681
Well.

1493
01:28:46,724 --> 01:28:48,639
That's just lazy writing.

1494
01:28:48,683 --> 01:28:49,965
Your boy's
gonna kill the headmaster

1495
01:28:49,989 --> 01:28:51,555
of the orphanage tonight.

1496
01:28:51,599 --> 01:28:53,731
After that,
he gets a real taste for it.

1497
01:28:53,775 --> 01:28:56,517
Like 10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!

1498
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,562
So he keeps killing...

1499
01:28:58,606 --> 01:29:00,086
and killing, and killing,

1500
01:29:00,129 --> 01:29:01,652
and killing.

1501
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,916
Until one day, he kills
the wrong fucking people.

1502
01:29:07,484 --> 01:29:08,877
My people.

1503
01:29:12,794 --> 01:29:14,056
Relax.

1504
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:16,493
I'm retrieving something
from my utility bag.

1505
01:29:16,537 --> 01:29:19,105
It's a goddamn fanny pack...

1506
01:29:19,148 --> 01:29:21,759
and you know it,
you sick son of a bitch!

1507
01:29:21,803 --> 01:29:23,457
The difference
is night and day.

1508
01:29:25,285 --> 01:29:27,548
You remind me of my wife.

1509
01:29:27,591 --> 01:29:29,071
I'm sorry.

1510
01:29:29,115 --> 01:29:30,222
I said, "You remind me
of my wife."

1511
01:29:30,246 --> 01:29:31,606
No, I'm sorry
that you said that...

1512
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:34,424
while making heavy eye contact
and applying lip balm.

1513
01:29:34,468 --> 01:29:35,643
She always struggled.

1514
01:29:36,774 --> 01:29:38,211
But she was funny...

1515
01:29:38,254 --> 01:29:41,605
and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor.

1516
01:29:41,649 --> 01:29:43,868
Something I could
never master.

1517
01:29:44,782 --> 01:29:47,002
It was my fault she died.

1518
01:29:48,612 --> 01:29:52,268
It was my job
to stop people like him.

1519
01:29:52,312 --> 01:29:54,270
<i>I came close a few times.</i>

1520
01:29:58,492 --> 01:30:00,146
<i>He wasn't too happy
about that.</i>

1521
01:30:01,886 --> 01:30:03,062
<i>He was trying to hurt me...</i>

1522
01:30:03,105 --> 01:30:05,064
and he knew exactly
how to do it.

1523
01:30:09,111 --> 01:30:10,808
Blessed are the wicked

1524
01:30:10,852 --> 01:30:12,419
who are healed by my hand.

1525
01:30:15,552 --> 01:30:17,902
<i>He came into my home...</i>

1526
01:30:17,946 --> 01:30:20,818
<i>and took the only thing
that made it a home.</i>

1527
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,389
Sound familiar?

1528
01:30:27,434 --> 01:30:29,088
- I'm sorry.
- Uh-huh.

1529
01:30:29,131 --> 01:30:30,785
No, I'm really sorry.

1530
01:30:33,004 --> 01:30:35,137
But that isn't Russell.

1531
01:30:35,181 --> 01:30:37,115
- It doesn't have to be him.
- If you knew what I knew...

1532
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:39,141
Yeah, he's got anger issues...

1533
01:30:39,185 --> 01:30:40,751
maybe a small
learning disability...

1534
01:30:40,795 --> 01:30:42,188
splash of diabetes...

1535
01:30:42,231 --> 01:30:43,580
but nothing
that can't be fixed.

1536
01:30:43,624 --> 01:30:45,278
If you could go back...

1537
01:30:45,321 --> 01:30:48,019
and stop the people that took
your girl, would you?

1538
01:30:48,281 --> 01:30:49,543
No.

1539
01:30:49,586 --> 01:30:51,327
I'd buy them all
a bouquet of hand jobs.

1540
01:30:51,371 --> 01:30:53,112
Of course I fucking would!

1541
01:30:53,895 --> 01:30:55,026
But I wouldn't kill a kid.

1542
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:57,116
I'm not asking you
to kill a kid!

1543
01:30:57,159 --> 01:30:58,726
I'll kill the kid.

1544
01:30:58,769 --> 01:31:02,251
I'm asking you to save
hundreds of other kids.

1545
01:31:02,295 --> 01:31:04,645
Russell's gonna burn down
that orphanage.

1546
01:31:04,688 --> 01:31:06,734
And I can imagine
your dead girlfriend...

1547
01:31:06,777 --> 01:31:09,040
would want you to do
the right thing, wouldn't she?

1548
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:13,219
So, what's it gonna be,
handsome?

1549
01:31:13,262 --> 01:31:15,003
Give me a chance to save him.

1550
01:31:15,046 --> 01:31:16,483
- What?
- You said...

1551
01:31:16,526 --> 01:31:18,200
once he kills someone,
he gets a taste for it.

1552
01:31:18,224 --> 01:31:20,574
If we can get to him
before that happens...

1553
01:31:20,617 --> 01:31:22,271
promise you'll give me
a chance

1554
01:31:22,315 --> 01:31:24,186
to put him
on a different path.

1555
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:25,405
Define "chance."

1556
01:31:25,448 --> 01:31:26,686
I don't know.
How long does it take

1557
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:28,079
to save someone's soul?
That's not...

1558
01:31:28,103 --> 01:31:29,365
I'll give you 30 seconds.

1559
01:31:29,409 --> 01:31:31,454
- What? No!
- Best I can do.

1560
01:31:31,498 --> 01:31:32,803
Take it or leave it.

1561
01:31:43,249 --> 01:31:44,728
He's doing it!

1562
01:31:44,772 --> 01:31:46,382
Look at the little fella.
He's doing it.

1563
01:31:46,426 --> 01:31:48,384
There he goes.

1564
01:31:48,428 --> 01:31:49,907
Jesus Christ!

1565
01:31:49,951 --> 01:31:51,431
Just shirt-cocking it.

1566
01:31:51,474 --> 01:31:53,389
Ugh.

1567
01:31:53,433 --> 01:31:54,793
There you go, little fella.

1568
01:31:55,522 --> 01:31:57,219
Go on, you're doing it!

1569
01:31:57,263 --> 01:32:00,135
My beautiful, hairless,
Twizzler-legged baby boy.

1570
01:32:02,311 --> 01:32:03,443
Christ!

1571
01:32:03,486 --> 01:32:05,184
That's disturbing.

1572
01:32:05,227 --> 01:32:06,620
30 seconds.

1573
01:32:12,016 --> 01:32:13,496
- Deal.
- Deal.

1574
01:32:19,937 --> 01:32:23,027
Man, that sucks they didn't
have anything in your size.

1575
01:32:23,071 --> 01:32:25,073
I really wanted to match,
you know?

1576
01:32:25,116 --> 01:32:27,162
Being a menacing team.

1577
01:32:27,206 --> 01:32:28,381
Oh, man, it sucks.

1578
01:32:28,424 --> 01:32:30,296
That was some
cold-ass shit, kid.

1579
01:32:31,688 --> 01:32:34,256
And that is just
the first five steps

1580
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:35,997
to a prostate-assisted orgasm.

1581
01:32:36,911 --> 01:32:38,347
Where the hell
are we going?

1582
01:32:38,391 --> 01:32:39,740
You said it yourself.

1583
01:32:39,783 --> 01:32:42,699
Nothing can stop the Juggernaut.
We need backup.

1584
01:32:42,743 --> 01:32:45,702
I will bathe in the blood
of your enemies.

1585
01:32:49,837 --> 01:32:51,447
Can you turn off the music?

1586
01:32:52,448 --> 01:32:54,581
You'll do no such thing.

1587
01:32:54,624 --> 01:32:56,496
Why don't you just say it
in an Indian accent?

1588
01:32:56,539 --> 01:32:58,280
- I'm sorry?
- Apology accepted.

1589
01:32:58,324 --> 01:33:00,413
This is a side of you
I do not like.

1590
01:33:00,456 --> 01:33:01,805
Let me guess,

1591
01:33:01,849 --> 01:33:03,348
some of your best friends
in the future are Indian.

1592
01:33:03,372 --> 01:33:04,634
What the hell are you...?

1593
01:33:04,678 --> 01:33:06,549
Once again, intolerance rears
its ugly head.

1594
01:33:06,593 --> 01:33:07,898
I am so sorry.
It gets better.

1595
01:33:07,942 --> 01:33:09,509
I'm not a fucking racist,
moron!

1596
01:33:09,552 --> 01:33:11,598
That's precisely
what a racist would say.

1597
01:33:11,641 --> 01:33:13,295
I'm with the old white guy
on this one.

1598
01:33:13,339 --> 01:33:14,601
And that's a twist.

1599
01:33:14,644 --> 01:33:16,167
When this is over...

1600
01:33:16,211 --> 01:33:18,102
I'm going to fuck you to death
with your own broken feet.

1601
01:33:18,126 --> 01:33:20,302
And a sexual predator, too.
That's rich.

1602
01:33:20,346 --> 01:33:21,738
I should have
finished college.

1603
01:33:21,782 --> 01:33:22,933
So what exactly do you

1604
01:33:22,957 --> 01:33:24,021
do in the future, anyway, huh?

1605
01:33:24,045 --> 01:33:25,307
Some kind of soldier?

1606
01:33:25,351 --> 01:33:27,178
Yeah, something like that.

1607
01:33:27,222 --> 01:33:29,398
I was a soldier. Special Forces.

1608
01:33:29,442 --> 01:33:32,140
I bet 50 years from now,
we're bestest buddies.

1609
01:33:32,183 --> 01:33:34,185
50 years from now,
you're very dead.

1610
01:33:34,229 --> 01:33:36,623
Your entire generation fucked
this planet into a coma.

1611
01:33:36,666 --> 01:33:38,277
Boom!

1612
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,582
Spoiler alert.

1613
01:33:40,801 --> 01:33:42,150
Planets.

1614
01:33:42,193 --> 01:33:43,760
Next time, Uber.

1615
01:33:43,804 --> 01:33:45,109
Here's a spoiler alert.

1616
01:33:46,285 --> 01:33:48,243
You're not a fucking hero.

1617
01:33:48,287 --> 01:33:52,334
You're just an annoying clown
dressed up as a sex toy.

1618
01:33:52,378 --> 01:33:53,572
Well, I got news for you.

1619
01:33:53,596 --> 01:33:54,945
My heart
is in the right place.

1620
01:33:54,989 --> 01:33:56,512
Russell's not
gonna kill anyone.

1621
01:33:56,556 --> 01:33:58,534
Because of me, he's gonna know
what real love looks like.

1622
01:33:58,558 --> 01:33:59,646
We're all going to die.

1623
01:33:59,689 --> 01:34:00,951
Because of you,
I'll always know

1624
01:34:00,995 --> 01:34:02,953
what a grown man
with baby balls looks like.

1625
01:34:02,997 --> 01:34:05,391
I'm a grower, not a shower.

1626
01:34:05,434 --> 01:34:06,609
God, I wish this were a bus

1627
01:34:06,653 --> 01:34:07,847
where I could pull
the string and get out.

1628
01:34:07,871 --> 01:34:09,525
It's a good thing
Cable's not driving,

1629
01:34:09,569 --> 01:34:10,787
or you'd be in the back.

1630
01:34:10,831 --> 01:34:13,181
- I am in the back.
- Right here!

1631
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:33,375
I made mistakes!

1632
01:34:33,419 --> 01:34:35,116
I wanna take them back!

1633
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:38,119
You trusted me.
I took that trust...

1634
01:34:38,162 --> 01:34:39,599
and turned it
into a glory hole

1635
01:34:39,642 --> 01:34:41,209
in an airport bathroom.

1636
01:34:41,252 --> 01:34:44,517
The one in Minneapolis.
You know the one.

1637
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,171
But even you know I'm not
a complete piece of shit.

1638
01:34:47,215 --> 01:34:48,738
I was once an X-Man.

1639
01:34:48,782 --> 01:34:49,826
Trainee!

1640
01:34:54,483 --> 01:34:57,051
You're still using
my Velcro labels. Aw.

1641
01:34:57,094 --> 01:34:58,705
They do stick better
than tape.

1642
01:34:58,748 --> 01:34:59,793
Hi, Wade!

1643
01:34:59,836 --> 01:35:01,272
Please don't.

1644
01:35:01,316 --> 01:35:03,710
Say whatever it is you're here
to say. Make it quick.

1645
01:35:03,753 --> 01:35:05,015
Right. Quick.

1646
01:35:05,059 --> 01:35:06,776
It's the kid.
Just like you, I let him down.

1647
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,236
And just like me,

1648
01:35:08,279 --> 01:35:09,431
he's never had anyone
sacrifice anything for him...

1649
01:35:09,455 --> 01:35:10,475
because the whole world
wrote him off

1650
01:35:10,499 --> 01:35:11,935
as a piece of shit
a long time ago.

1651
01:35:11,979 --> 01:35:13,676
Look, he's teamed up
with the Juggernaut!

1652
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,243
The Juggernaut!

1653
01:35:15,286 --> 01:35:17,047
Who's, like, my favorite
Marvel character ever...

1654
01:35:17,071 --> 01:35:19,290
And hi, Yukio! That was really
nice of you to say hi...

1655
01:35:19,334 --> 01:35:20,683
so I'm saying hi back.

1656
01:35:20,727 --> 01:35:22,119
You guys make
a super cute couple.

1657
01:35:22,163 --> 01:35:23,860
Yeah. Where was I?

1658
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,775
Oh, yeah. You should never
meet your heroes...

1659
01:35:25,819 --> 01:35:27,516
because, honestly,
he's a bit of a dick!

1660
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,400
And like a lot of dicks,
he's hard as a rock...

1661
01:35:29,431 --> 01:35:30,824
and causes nothing
but problems!

1662
01:35:30,867 --> 01:35:33,740
Look, you can stop the
Juggernaut. I know you can.

1663
01:35:33,783 --> 01:35:37,004
Do you know what would happen
to me if I helped you?

1664
01:35:37,047 --> 01:35:39,136
I would be disgraced.

1665
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:41,225
You are a criminal,
a fugitive.

1666
01:35:41,269 --> 01:35:42,792
But worst of all...

1667
01:35:42,836 --> 01:35:44,577
you broke my heart, Wade.

1668
01:35:46,274 --> 01:35:47,493
Then you know what?

1669
01:35:47,536 --> 01:35:49,136
Your heart's in
the wrong place, big guy.

1670
01:35:50,191 --> 01:35:52,889
Doing the right thing
is sometimes messy...

1671
01:35:52,933 --> 01:35:56,327
and fucked up, and not
particularly convenient!

1672
01:35:56,371 --> 01:35:59,461
So stay here
in Chateau de Virgin...

1673
01:35:59,505 --> 01:36:01,637
while we go get our fuck on!

1674
01:36:04,814 --> 01:36:06,207
You're doing great.

1675
01:36:11,865 --> 01:36:13,408
So you wear
that helmet because

1676
01:36:13,432 --> 01:36:15,172
your brother
tries to read your mind?

1677
01:36:15,216 --> 01:36:18,480
Yeah, but he's in
a wheelchair, so even-steven.

1678
01:36:18,524 --> 01:36:21,004
Someone's coming.
It's Russell, sir.

1679
01:36:21,048 --> 01:36:23,006
And he's not alone.

1680
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:24,704
Secure the children.

1681
01:36:27,141 --> 01:36:29,883
They will not replace us.

1682
01:36:29,926 --> 01:36:32,712
What do you say
we go fuck some shit up?

1683
01:36:32,755 --> 01:36:36,585
"Let's fuck some shit up"
is my legal middle name.

1684
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:42,548
Watch my back.
I've got the old man.

1685
01:36:42,591 --> 01:36:44,158
Amen, brother.

1686
01:36:50,686 --> 01:36:52,340
Time to make the chimichangas.

1687
01:36:52,383 --> 01:36:54,560
30 seconds.

1688
01:36:54,603 --> 01:36:57,127
I finally know why I'm here.

1689
01:36:57,171 --> 01:36:59,129
I was raised in this place.

1690
01:36:59,173 --> 01:37:01,436
Well, not raised.
I was tortured.

1691
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:04,352
Wow! It's your cosmic reason
for being here.

1692
01:37:04,395 --> 01:37:05,701
- Shall we?
- This is gonna be fun.

1693
01:37:05,745 --> 01:37:06,833
Yeah!

1694
01:37:06,876 --> 01:37:08,269
Hey! Been meaning
to ask you...

1695
01:37:08,312 --> 01:37:11,577
what's with the dirty,
disgusting hobo bear?

1696
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:14,797
It's not dirt. It's the blood
of my dead daughter.

1697
01:37:14,841 --> 01:37:17,539
Are You Bear, God?
It's Me, Margaret.

1698
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:19,019
Give me some.

1699
01:37:19,062 --> 01:37:20,629
They say
laughter heals anything...

1700
01:37:20,673 --> 01:37:21,804
except, of course, that.

1701
01:37:21,848 --> 01:37:23,066
We should just cue the music.

1702
01:37:48,222 --> 01:37:50,920
Welcome home, Russell.
We missed you.

1703
01:37:52,139 --> 01:37:53,183
Russell!

1704
01:37:53,227 --> 01:37:56,622
You don't need to do this!
Let's talk!

1705
01:37:56,665 --> 01:37:57,990
Why are you dressed
like the Unabomber?

1706
01:38:02,323 --> 01:38:03,585
That's why!

1707
01:38:03,629 --> 01:38:04,954
Told you this little fucker's
too far gone.

1708
01:38:04,978 --> 01:38:06,695
Zip it, Thanos!
We have a deal and you fuck...

1709
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:09,199
Hey!

1710
01:38:09,243 --> 01:38:12,376
I'm gonna shove that
cab driver right up your ass.

1711
01:38:13,508 --> 01:38:15,684
My body and my hands
are so soft.

1712
01:38:15,728 --> 01:38:16,966
You should probably
head back to the car.

1713
01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:18,687
I think I'll head
back to the car.

1714
01:38:19,862 --> 01:38:22,561
It works best
when you pull the trigger.

1715
01:38:25,476 --> 01:38:26,739
That gun is amazing!

1716
01:38:28,088 --> 01:38:29,306
Say it!

1717
01:38:31,482 --> 01:38:34,529
You are an abomination!

1718
01:38:41,797 --> 01:38:45,105
Now, I'm gonna shove
the red guy up the old guy.

1719
01:38:45,148 --> 01:38:47,586
I believe him!
Every man for themselves!

1720
01:38:51,938 --> 01:38:53,026
Gotcha!

1721
01:38:53,809 --> 01:38:54,984
Beat it, midget!

1722
01:38:57,987 --> 01:39:01,077
Hey, big guy,
the sun's getting real low!

1723
01:39:01,121 --> 01:39:02,209
Oh, shit fuck!

1724
01:39:16,092 --> 01:39:17,659
Come here, beautiful.

1725
01:39:25,449 --> 01:39:26,581
Whoo!

1726
01:39:35,764 --> 01:39:36,852
Say it!

1727
01:41:00,327 --> 01:41:01,458
You came for me.

1728
01:41:01,502 --> 01:41:02,938
I'm not giving up on you,

1729
01:41:02,982 --> 01:41:05,114
and you are not
giving up on that boy.

1730
01:41:05,158 --> 01:41:07,203
Who says that rules
aren't meant to be broken?

1731
01:41:07,247 --> 01:41:09,640
It's time to fight dirty.

1732
01:41:09,684 --> 01:41:11,033
Time to sweep the leg, Johnny.

1733
01:41:11,077 --> 01:41:13,862
Hey! Pick on someone
your own size!

1734
01:41:13,906 --> 01:41:15,995
That's such
a you thing to say!

1735
01:41:16,038 --> 01:41:17,997
Go get him, tiger!

1736
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,912
Big CGI fight coming up!

1737
01:41:42,978 --> 01:41:44,371
He's doing great.

1738
01:41:44,414 --> 01:41:45,633
Say it!

1739
01:41:49,811 --> 01:41:51,204
- Russell.
- Bingo!

1740
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,602
You see that bus?

1741
01:41:58,646 --> 01:41:59,846
I'm gonna
shove it up your ass.

1742
01:42:03,216 --> 01:42:05,174
That's right!
I'm fighting dirty!

1743
01:42:06,088 --> 01:42:07,133
Oh, great!

1744
01:42:07,176 --> 01:42:08,588
There they are! Those freaks!

1745
01:42:08,612 --> 01:42:10,721
A bunch of armed
pedophiles in nursing shoes.

1746
01:42:10,745 --> 01:42:12,878
Can I have
one of those guns?

1747
01:42:12,921 --> 01:42:14,749
- No.
- That's fine.

1748
01:42:14,793 --> 01:42:16,751
Get off this property,
mutant scum!

1749
01:42:16,795 --> 01:42:17,955
I'm just gonna
use this brick.

1750
01:42:18,535 --> 01:42:19,623
Maximum effort.

1751
01:42:25,673 --> 01:42:27,414
Who says you
can't go home again?

1752
01:42:36,510 --> 01:42:37,903
Oh!

1753
01:42:44,561 --> 01:42:45,562
Yeah!

1754
01:42:47,782 --> 01:42:49,436
Say it.

1755
01:42:49,479 --> 01:42:52,526
Say what you said
every time you tortured me!

1756
01:42:53,048 --> 01:42:54,397
Say it!

1757
01:42:54,441 --> 01:42:57,139
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand!

1758
01:42:58,358 --> 01:43:00,490
Blessed are the wicked...

1759
01:43:00,534 --> 01:43:01,752
who are healed...

1760
01:43:02,231 --> 01:43:03,754
by my hand.

1761
01:43:21,816 --> 01:43:23,513
You commie motherfucker!

1762
01:43:50,584 --> 01:43:53,108
Oh, my God.
Did you feel that, too?

1763
01:43:53,152 --> 01:43:55,371
Only best buddies
execute pedophiles together.

1764
01:43:58,244 --> 01:44:00,594
You got 30 seconds,
you jabbering butt plug!

1765
01:44:00,637 --> 01:44:01,856
Now we're getting it.

1766
01:44:06,556 --> 01:44:08,819
I need a bus
to get you all out of here.

1767
01:44:14,086 --> 01:44:15,130
Orphans.

1768
01:44:16,305 --> 01:44:17,524
Oh, geez.

1769
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,658
It's time to burn
for what you've done!

1770
01:44:21,702 --> 01:44:24,183
A child should not be burdened
with such power!

1771
01:44:33,018 --> 01:44:34,062
Russell! Wait!

1772
01:44:40,068 --> 01:44:41,374
Oh!

1773
01:44:48,598 --> 01:44:50,731
Wait! He hasn't killed
anyone yet!

1774
01:44:50,774 --> 01:44:52,796
- What more do you need to see?
- Don't you fucking dare!

1775
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:53,995
He's just a kid!

1776
01:44:54,039 --> 01:44:55,954
Tick, tock. Meter's running!

1777
01:45:08,662 --> 01:45:11,708
I'm gonna melt you down
and make a cock ring.

1778
01:45:32,077 --> 01:45:34,731
- I told you! Leave me alone!
- Come on!

1779
01:45:35,254 --> 01:45:36,385
Listen to me!

1780
01:45:59,626 --> 01:46:01,280
That's how we do it

1781
01:46:01,323 --> 01:46:02,803
in Mother Russia.

1782
01:46:05,023 --> 01:46:07,547
They say millennials are
the hardest to reach.

1783
01:46:08,939 --> 01:46:12,160
Oh, no.
You're doing amazing.

1784
01:46:13,466 --> 01:46:16,338
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta!

1785
01:46:16,382 --> 01:46:18,210
Go home, Wade!

1786
01:46:18,253 --> 01:46:20,081
You're ruining everything!

1787
01:46:25,434 --> 01:46:26,783
I'm getting good at this shit.

1788
01:46:26,827 --> 01:46:28,133
Go, go, go!

1789
01:46:31,353 --> 01:46:33,312
He dies tonight, Wade.

1790
01:46:33,355 --> 01:46:35,836
You can't stop me!

1791
01:46:35,879 --> 01:46:37,751
He even runs
like a fucking pervert.

1792
01:46:37,794 --> 01:46:40,536
Like an online predator
who lost his laptop.

1793
01:46:41,972 --> 01:46:43,452
There's one bullet left
in that gun.

1794
01:46:43,496 --> 01:46:45,498
Wait, wait, wait!
Please, just give me a second!

1795
01:46:45,541 --> 01:46:47,021
I got this.

1796
01:46:47,065 --> 01:46:49,284
- Russell!
- Stay back! Go home, Wade!

1797
01:46:49,328 --> 01:46:52,026
Let's talk. It doesn't
have to go this way!

1798
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:53,723
That piece of shit...

1799
01:46:53,767 --> 01:46:55,508
he deserves to die
for what he did to you.

1800
01:46:55,551 --> 01:46:58,946
He hurt you badly.
Makes you wanna hurt others.

1801
01:46:59,816 --> 01:47:01,601
But if you kill him, he wins.

1802
01:47:01,644 --> 01:47:05,518
You become everything
he says you are, but worse.

1803
01:47:05,561 --> 01:47:07,563
You're just a kid.

1804
01:47:07,607 --> 01:47:09,348
You don't wanna hurt anyone.

1805
01:47:09,391 --> 01:47:10,653
How do you know what I want?

1806
01:47:10,697 --> 01:47:12,307
Because I've been inside you.

1807
01:47:13,003 --> 01:47:14,875
That came out wrong.

1808
01:47:14,918 --> 01:47:16,616
I've been inside your shoes.

1809
01:47:16,659 --> 01:47:18,531
Which is also off-putting.

1810
01:47:18,574 --> 01:47:20,054
It's not a great analogy.

1811
01:47:20,098 --> 01:47:21,925
The point is...

1812
01:47:21,969 --> 01:47:23,666
there are people...

1813
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:26,756
There are people
in this fucking world...

1814
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,498
besides him,
who will treat you right.

1815
01:47:29,542 --> 01:47:32,153
It isn't too late.
Don't do it.

1816
01:47:37,724 --> 01:47:40,118
I never should've left
you there.

1817
01:47:41,858 --> 01:47:43,730
I never should've left you
in that prison.

1818
01:47:50,824 --> 01:47:52,130
I can't trust you.

1819
01:47:53,827 --> 01:47:56,177
I can't trust anybody!

1820
01:48:05,404 --> 01:48:06,666
Wonderful kid.

1821
01:48:06,709 --> 01:48:08,494
You can't stop me, Wade!

1822
01:48:10,713 --> 01:48:12,976
I got one more idea.

1823
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:15,936
It's just a really bad one,
even for me.

1824
01:48:15,979 --> 01:48:17,242
Wade, what are you doing?

1825
01:48:17,285 --> 01:48:19,592
All right. This is for
all the marbles, kid!

1826
01:48:19,635 --> 01:48:21,724
You're gonna kill
someone today...

1827
01:48:21,768 --> 01:48:23,204
Blessed are the wicked...

1828
01:48:23,248 --> 01:48:25,163
...then it's gotta be me.

1829
01:48:26,251 --> 01:48:28,166
...who are healed by my hand!

1830
01:48:31,256 --> 01:48:33,693
Fuck this!

1831
01:49:34,406 --> 01:49:37,365
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

1832
01:49:42,370 --> 01:49:43,893
Oh, that's not good.

1833
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:46,896
No, sir.

1834
01:49:54,513 --> 01:49:57,429
You sacrificed yourself
for me.

1835
01:49:57,864 --> 01:49:59,039
Yeah.

1836
01:49:59,082 --> 01:50:01,302
And it was the best thing
I ever did.

1837
01:50:03,261 --> 01:50:05,350
I told you
I care about you.

1838
01:50:05,393 --> 01:50:07,177
You're a good kid, Russell.

1839
01:50:08,875 --> 01:50:09,963
Hey.

1840
01:50:11,269 --> 01:50:12,487
The bear.

1841
01:50:12,531 --> 01:50:13,923
It worked.

1842
01:50:20,887 --> 01:50:22,497
Because of you.

1843
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:24,847
No, Wade, because of you.

1844
01:50:25,718 --> 01:50:27,807
Stop, stop, stop!

1845
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:29,025
Stop!

1846
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:33,160
Just let it happen, okay?

1847
01:50:33,203 --> 01:50:36,903
I guess my heart was finally
in the right place.

1848
01:50:36,946 --> 01:50:39,340
That riddle is so fucked up.

1849
01:50:44,171 --> 01:50:46,565
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1850
01:50:46,608 --> 01:50:47,957
Don't be. Don't be.

1851
01:50:48,001 --> 01:50:50,220
I've been trying to make
this happen for a while.

1852
01:50:50,264 --> 01:50:51,918
Please, just don't leave me.

1853
01:50:51,961 --> 01:50:53,572
I don't wanna die
without an audience.

1854
01:50:53,615 --> 01:50:55,269
We are not going anywhere.

1855
01:50:55,313 --> 01:50:57,402
Oh, God, I hope
the Academy is watching.

1856
01:50:57,445 --> 01:50:58,577
Just rest, okay?

1857
01:51:00,405 --> 01:51:01,493
Papa.

1858
01:51:03,712 --> 01:51:05,671
<i>♫ Papa, can you hear me? ♫</i>

1859
01:51:07,934 --> 01:51:13,940
<i>♫ Papa, can you find me
in the night? ♫</i>

1860
01:51:35,222 --> 01:51:36,963
Before I go...

1861
01:51:37,006 --> 01:51:38,704
Sorry, I got a bit more in me.

1862
01:51:39,313 --> 01:51:40,662
Domino.

1863
01:51:40,706 --> 01:51:45,145
I want you to have
my <i>Adventure Time</i> watch.

1864
01:51:47,669 --> 01:51:50,542
Turns out
that I'm the lucky one.

1865
01:51:51,325 --> 01:51:52,413
Thank you.

1866
01:51:53,762 --> 01:51:57,026
Hey, Sabrina,
the Teenage Witch.

1867
01:51:57,070 --> 01:51:59,377
I liked you better
with your hair short.

1868
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:00,552
Think everyone did.

1869
01:52:01,379 --> 01:52:04,120
- Hi, Yukio.
- Hi, Wade!

1870
01:52:06,122 --> 01:52:07,210
And you...

1871
01:52:07,733 --> 01:52:09,735
Chrome Bone.

1872
01:52:09,778 --> 01:52:12,694
I haven't always been
the best friend to you.

1873
01:52:12,738 --> 01:52:15,044
But you've always been
that to me.

1874
01:52:15,088 --> 01:52:16,437
So thank you.

1875
01:52:18,613 --> 01:52:20,223
Say "fuck" for me.

1876
01:52:21,050 --> 01:52:22,356
Just once. Come on,

1877
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,010
we'll do it together.
It's no big deal.

1878
01:52:24,053 --> 01:52:27,100
Here we go. One, two, three.
F... F... F...

1879
01:52:27,143 --> 01:52:28,318
Fuck.

1880
01:52:28,362 --> 01:52:31,626
Wow! Enjoy hell, swamp mouth.

1881
01:52:32,975 --> 01:52:36,065
And you, Cable.

1882
01:52:36,109 --> 01:52:40,592
You get back to your family.
You tell 'em Wade says hi.

1883
01:52:40,635 --> 01:52:44,291
And promise me.
Promise me one thing.

1884
01:52:44,334 --> 01:52:45,727
That you'll start
judging people...

1885
01:52:45,771 --> 01:52:47,163
not by the color
of their skin,

1886
01:52:47,207 --> 01:52:49,078
but by the content
of their character.

1887
01:52:49,818 --> 01:52:51,429
- Jesus.
- R-Dog?

1888
01:52:52,604 --> 01:52:55,084
There you are. Hey!

1889
01:52:55,128 --> 01:52:57,347
You're a superhero now, bubba.

1890
01:52:57,391 --> 01:53:00,394
That's why it's high time
that you had a super suit.

1891
01:53:00,438 --> 01:53:01,830
This one is yours.

1892
01:53:01,874 --> 01:53:03,615
You might wanna
get it steam cleaned.

1893
01:53:03,658 --> 01:53:05,094
Especially around the pants.

1894
01:53:05,138 --> 01:53:06,835
And let it out
a little in the waist.

1895
01:53:07,793 --> 01:53:08,794
But, hey.

1896
01:53:09,838 --> 01:53:11,187
Look.

1897
01:53:11,231 --> 01:53:13,842
Family is not an F-word.

1898
01:53:14,582 --> 01:53:15,931
All right?

1899
01:53:15,975 --> 01:53:18,412
There's one out there for you.

1900
01:53:18,456 --> 01:53:20,153
Just keep looking, okay?

1901
01:53:23,635 --> 01:53:26,420
Guys, for a second there...

1902
01:53:27,247 --> 01:53:29,379
we made a pretty good team.

1903
01:53:44,438 --> 01:53:46,440
Oh, it's so hard to go.

1904
01:53:48,007 --> 01:53:50,313
I just love being around
you guys so much.

1905
01:53:51,401 --> 01:53:52,620
So, so much.

1906
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:54,709
Mmm.

1907
01:53:54,753 --> 01:53:57,582
No, I can feel it now.
Here it comes, yeah.

1908
01:53:57,625 --> 01:54:01,455
I feel the soul
exiting the husk.

1909
01:54:01,499 --> 01:54:02,500
Yeah.

1910
01:54:04,371 --> 01:54:06,852
Can you see it?

1911
01:54:06,895 --> 01:54:09,071
Do you see
that beautiful bright light?

1912
01:54:10,551 --> 01:54:11,683
There it is.

1913
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:19,212
Oh, that's the sun.

1914
01:54:19,255 --> 01:54:21,127
Don't stare
directly into that.

1915
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:22,607
I just have a few final words.

1916
01:54:24,826 --> 01:54:26,219
Woodpecker.

1917
01:54:27,002 --> 01:54:28,351
Gingivitis.

1918
01:54:30,397 --> 01:54:31,746
Codswallop.

1919
01:54:36,098 --> 01:54:38,057
<i>Do You Want to
Build a Snowman?</i>

1920
01:55:53,045 --> 01:55:54,263
Sorry I'm late.

1921
01:55:54,307 --> 01:55:56,004
There was a bunch

1922
01:55:56,048 --> 01:55:57,416
of handicapable children
who were stuck in a tree.

1923
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,660
- No.
- No.

1924
01:55:59,704 --> 01:56:02,794
- But I did have to help a kid.
- Yeah.

1925
01:56:02,837 --> 01:56:04,752
- He's got a terrible name.
- It's just awful.

1926
01:56:04,796 --> 01:56:05,797
- Ugh.
- I tried to tell him.

1927
01:56:08,147 --> 01:56:09,583
Is this heaven?

1928
01:56:10,453 --> 01:56:11,629
It is now.

1929
01:56:15,110 --> 01:56:16,982
I am so sorry.

1930
01:56:17,809 --> 01:56:19,158
It's okay.

1931
01:56:39,004 --> 01:56:40,875
I missed you so much.

1932
01:56:46,489 --> 01:56:48,143
What is it? What's wrong?

1933
01:56:50,058 --> 01:56:52,147
It's not time.

1934
01:56:52,191 --> 01:56:54,193
What do you mean
it's not time?

1935
01:56:54,236 --> 01:56:55,847
I'm here, I made it.

1936
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:57,631
- You can't stay.
- No, no, no.

1937
01:56:57,675 --> 01:57:00,329
I'm staying. I'm not going
anywhere without you.

1938
01:57:00,373 --> 01:57:01,809
It's okay.

1939
01:57:01,853 --> 01:57:04,682
There's a time for us.
It's just not now.

1940
01:57:05,726 --> 01:57:08,163
- They need you.
- Who?

1941
01:57:10,209 --> 01:57:11,514
Your F-word.

1942
01:57:12,777 --> 01:57:13,778
Why?

1943
01:57:13,821 --> 01:57:14,822
You'll find out.

1944
01:57:16,084 --> 01:57:17,651
It's all right. I'll be here.

1945
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,786
It's pretty fucking
awesome over here.

1946
01:57:21,829 --> 01:57:23,744
I can have anything I want.

1947
01:57:23,788 --> 01:57:25,920
Can every day be
International Women's Day?

1948
01:57:25,964 --> 01:57:27,530
It is heaven.

1949
01:57:27,574 --> 01:57:28,793
I love you.

1950
01:57:31,317 --> 01:57:34,059
I know. I love you, too.

1951
01:57:34,668 --> 01:57:36,061
Now, go.

1952
01:57:36,931 --> 01:57:38,933
Go on. Go, get out of here.

1953
01:57:39,978 --> 01:57:40,979
Go.

1954
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:44,808
Hey!

1955
01:57:47,812 --> 01:57:49,944
Kiss me
like you miss me, Red.

1956
01:57:50,597 --> 01:57:51,729
Well, come here.

1957
01:58:11,052 --> 01:58:12,793
Don't fuck Elvis.

1958
01:58:12,837 --> 01:58:14,577
- Ooh, too late.
- I'm sorry?

1959
01:58:24,065 --> 01:58:25,327
Time to make the chimichangas.

1960
01:58:25,371 --> 01:58:26,502
30 seconds.

1961
01:58:26,546 --> 01:58:27,808
Hey. Been meaning
to ask you...

1962
01:58:27,852 --> 01:58:30,332
what's with the creepy,
dirty hobo bear?

1963
01:58:30,376 --> 01:58:32,552
It's my daughter's teddy bear.

1964
01:58:32,595 --> 01:58:34,119
Her name's Hope.

1965
01:58:34,162 --> 01:58:35,294
Well...

1966
01:58:36,121 --> 01:58:38,036
What are you doing?

1967
01:58:38,079 --> 01:58:39,733
Somebody swiped right.

1968
01:58:52,485 --> 01:58:55,270
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

1969
01:58:58,186 --> 01:58:59,971
You sacrificed yourself for me.

1970
01:59:00,014 --> 01:59:01,537
It would seem I...

1971
01:59:03,713 --> 01:59:04,976
Huh?

1972
01:59:06,107 --> 01:59:08,457
Genuine, high-grade lead.

1973
01:59:10,372 --> 01:59:13,419
You time-sliding
son of a bitch!

1974
01:59:13,462 --> 01:59:15,029
You did this for me?

1975
01:59:16,901 --> 01:59:19,991
Wait. You can't go back.

1976
01:59:20,034 --> 01:59:21,340
You used
the last of your fuel.

1977
01:59:21,383 --> 01:59:23,124
What about your girl,
your wife?

1978
01:59:23,168 --> 01:59:26,432
Now, my family's safe.
And I didn't do it for you.

1979
01:59:27,912 --> 01:59:30,349
No, I'm gonna stick around
for a while...

1980
01:59:30,392 --> 01:59:31,654
and make sure the world

1981
01:59:31,698 --> 01:59:33,395
doesn't shit itself
into oblivion.

1982
01:59:34,092 --> 01:59:36,964
No. You did it for me.

1983
01:59:37,747 --> 01:59:39,184
No, I didn't.

1984
01:59:39,227 --> 01:59:40,663
- You did.
- I really didn't.

1985
01:59:40,707 --> 01:59:42,547
- Pretty sure you did.
- No, I'm positive I didn't.

1986
01:59:42,578 --> 01:59:44,363
Fine. All right,
let's flip a coin. Okay?

1987
01:59:44,406 --> 01:59:47,148
Heads, you did it for me.
Tails, you did it for me.

1988
01:59:47,192 --> 01:59:49,977
I'm not even gonna look,
because you did it for me.

1989
01:59:50,021 --> 01:59:51,152
Say it again.

1990
01:59:51,196 --> 01:59:52,806
- He did it for me.
- Jesus.

1991
01:59:52,850 --> 01:59:54,653
- We must get the collar off.
- Forget it. It's no use.

1992
01:59:54,677 --> 01:59:56,592
These collars
don't just come off.

1993
01:59:56,636 --> 01:59:58,116
Wade.

1994
01:59:58,159 --> 02:00:00,074
I have an idea.

1995
02:00:00,118 --> 02:00:02,250
No, no, no!
Let's not do that. Please!

1996
02:00:02,294 --> 02:00:04,731
I'd rather die of cancer.
Let's just...

1997
02:00:04,774 --> 02:00:07,908
Oh, God! They do say the pen
is grosser than the sword.

1998
02:00:07,952 --> 02:00:10,258
We need the code.

1999
02:00:10,302 --> 02:00:12,217
Try, uh, seven?

2000
02:00:12,260 --> 02:00:13,871
Settle down, Captain Lucky.

2001
02:00:13,914 --> 02:00:15,350
It's not gonna be one number.

2002
02:00:15,394 --> 02:00:16,554
Oh, God, that's lazy writing.

2003
02:00:17,483 --> 02:00:18,832
I still got it.

2004
02:00:21,879 --> 02:00:23,837
Put that back
in your prison wallet.

2005
02:00:25,534 --> 02:00:27,449
I don't know how to thank you.

2006
02:00:27,493 --> 02:00:29,408
But I do know how to hug you.

2007
02:00:29,451 --> 02:00:30,757
- No.
- Yes.

2008
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:32,280
Here we go. Bring it in.

2009
02:00:32,324 --> 02:00:33,412
Come on.

2010
02:00:33,455 --> 02:00:34,892
Pelvis to pelvis.

2011
02:00:34,935 --> 02:00:36,284
Let's go tip to tip.

2012
02:00:36,328 --> 02:00:38,896
There we go.
The kids call this docking.

2013
02:00:40,593 --> 02:00:42,160
Is there a knife in my dick?

2014
02:00:42,203 --> 02:00:44,007
- There's a knife in your dick.
- I'm just gonna back up now.

2015
02:00:44,031 --> 02:00:45,946
- Yeah, yeah.
- No need to go full <i>Yentl.</i>

2016
02:00:45,990 --> 02:00:48,775
Gonna pretend
like that never happened.

2017
02:00:48,818 --> 02:00:50,733
Let's go home, Russell.

2018
02:00:54,389 --> 02:00:56,174
All you dirty mutants

2019
02:00:56,217 --> 02:00:58,785
are gonna rot in hell
with the boy!

2020
02:00:58,828 --> 02:01:01,919
Your souls
are beyond redemption!

2021
02:01:01,962 --> 02:01:03,224
Let's see your soul, perv!

2022
02:01:03,268 --> 02:01:06,097
No, no! No! No more!
We're better than that!

2023
02:01:06,140 --> 02:01:07,446
We're better than him!

2024
02:01:07,489 --> 02:01:10,101
No more senseless violence!
No more bloodshed!

2025
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:11,754
We'll let karma
take care of him.

2026
02:01:11,798 --> 02:01:14,801
The day of reckoning is here!

2027
02:01:24,115 --> 02:01:26,204
I'm gonna miss him.
He seemed great.

2028
02:01:26,247 --> 02:01:27,466
Whoo!

2029
02:01:27,509 --> 02:01:29,120
Courage, motherfuckers!

2030
02:01:29,163 --> 02:01:30,643
And karma, motherfucker.

2031
02:01:30,686 --> 02:01:32,099
I could hear you
coming the last 30 seconds.

2032
02:01:32,123 --> 02:01:34,125
I could barely keep
a straight face.

2033
02:01:34,168 --> 02:01:36,083
I want some more.

2034
02:01:36,127 --> 02:01:37,867
I bet you do, Brown Panther.

2035
02:01:37,911 --> 02:01:41,436
We should leave
before Fuckernaut wakes up.

2036
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:43,743
Good call.
You guys coming with us?

2037
02:01:43,786 --> 02:01:45,745
No, we'll get the kids
back to the mansion.

2038
02:01:45,788 --> 02:01:47,312
Besides, we're X-Men.

2039
02:01:47,355 --> 02:01:50,010
No, you're X-People.

2040
02:01:50,054 --> 02:01:51,403
You're X-hausting.

2041
02:01:51,446 --> 02:01:53,231
I see what you did there.
Puns.

2042
02:01:53,274 --> 02:01:54,710
Our door's always open.

2043
02:01:54,754 --> 02:01:56,538
That's kind, but
I'm not ready to date again.

2044
02:01:56,582 --> 02:01:57,583
Let alone two women.

2045
02:01:58,714 --> 02:02:00,412
God, you're a douche.

2046
02:02:00,455 --> 02:02:02,588
- Bye, Wade!
- Bye, Yukio!

2047
02:02:05,286 --> 02:02:06,592
<i>What do you get</i>

2048
02:02:06,635 --> 02:02:07,549
<i>when you take
eight feet of chrome...</i>

2049
02:02:07,593 --> 02:02:08,768
<i>one pinch of courage...</i>

2050
02:02:08,811 --> 02:02:10,030
<i>a cup of good luck...</i>

2051
02:02:10,074 --> 02:02:11,640
<i>a dab of racism...</i>

2052
02:02:11,684 --> 02:02:13,207
<i>a splash of diabetes...</i>

2053
02:02:13,251 --> 02:02:15,644
<i>and a wheelbarrow
full of stage four cancer?</i>

2054
02:02:15,688 --> 02:02:18,386
<i>Answer: a family.</i>

2055
02:02:18,430 --> 02:02:21,563
<i>See? I didn't lie
what kind of film this was.</i>

2056
02:02:21,607 --> 02:02:23,150
<i>If there's anything
you take away today...</i>

2057
02:02:23,174 --> 02:02:26,133
<i>other than the need to Google,
"What the fuck is dubstep?"...</i>

2058
02:02:26,177 --> 02:02:29,006
<i>it's that we all need
to belong to someone.</i>

2059
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:27,820
How something
so small generates

2060
02:04:27,863 --> 02:04:29,430
enough energy
to reverse time is...

2061
02:04:29,474 --> 02:04:31,867
Oh, just fix it, Eleven,

2062
02:04:31,911 --> 02:04:34,174
or I'll take it
to the Genius Bar.

2063
02:04:34,218 --> 02:04:35,456
Cable's gonna kill you
when he finds out.

2064
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:36,524
Never heard of him.

2065
02:04:36,568 --> 02:04:38,047
Why do you think
I'm helping him?

2066
02:04:39,310 --> 02:04:41,573
The Lord works
in mysterious ways,

2067
02:04:41,616 --> 02:04:43,879
don't I? A good day.

2068
02:04:44,619 --> 02:04:45,620
Bye, Wade!

2069
02:04:46,143 --> 02:04:47,144
Bye, Yukio!

2070
02:04:48,449 --> 02:04:50,973
That was probably a bad idea.

2071
02:04:51,017 --> 02:04:52,018
What have we done?

2072
02:05:10,558 --> 02:05:12,604
I hope we sharpened
the cream cheese spreader.

2073
02:05:22,744 --> 02:05:24,181
I'll be right back!

2074
02:05:26,183 --> 02:05:28,707
We're definitely naming
our kid Cher!

2075
02:05:29,098 --> 02:05:30,099
Whoo!

2076
02:05:31,927 --> 02:05:33,233
Peter!

2077
02:05:33,277 --> 02:05:34,843
Whoo! X-Force!

2078
02:05:34,887 --> 02:05:37,933
Walk away! Just walk away!

2079
02:05:37,977 --> 02:05:39,979
- But we're X-Force!
- Nope! We're not.

2080
02:05:40,022 --> 02:05:41,372
X-Force is just
a marketing tool

2081
02:05:41,415 --> 02:05:42,721
designed by Fox executives...

2082
02:05:42,764 --> 02:05:44,462
to keep Josh Brolin employed.

2083
02:05:44,505 --> 02:05:46,028
It doesn't exist.

2084
02:05:46,072 --> 02:05:49,380
All right, well,
this has been pretty scary!

2085
02:05:49,423 --> 02:05:51,120
And I need to feed my cat!

2086
02:05:51,164 --> 02:05:53,645
Go home, Sugarbear. Go home.

2087
02:05:53,688 --> 02:05:56,952
Okay. Will you give
Domino my email?

2088
02:06:06,135 --> 02:06:08,007
Wade, is that you?

2089
02:06:10,270 --> 02:06:11,619
I guess Stryker finally

2090
02:06:11,663 --> 02:06:13,055
figured out
how to shut you up.

2091
02:06:19,627 --> 02:06:23,022
Hey! It's me!
Don't scratch!

2092
02:06:23,065 --> 02:06:25,111
Just cleaning up
the timelines!

2093
02:06:25,154 --> 02:06:28,984
Look, eventually you're
going to hang up the claws...

2094
02:06:29,028 --> 02:06:31,248
and it's gonna make
a lot of people very sad.

2095
02:06:31,639 --> 02:06:33,032
Huh?

2096
02:06:33,075 --> 02:06:34,401
But one day, your old pal
Wade's gonna ask you...

2097
02:06:34,425 --> 02:06:36,383
to get back
in the saddle again.

2098
02:06:37,297 --> 02:06:39,821
And when he does,
say yes.

2099
02:06:41,083 --> 02:06:43,042
Oh, right.

2100
02:06:43,956 --> 02:06:45,262
Love you!

2101
02:06:47,612 --> 02:06:49,266
Goddamn, that's beautiful.

2102
02:06:56,621 --> 02:06:58,449
You're welcome, Canada.

2103
02:07:10,983 --> 02:07:12,158
Boy howdy.

2104
02:07:14,029 --> 02:07:16,945
Hi. This is a toughie.

2105
02:07:16,989 --> 02:07:18,425
Yeesh.

2106
02:07:18,469 --> 02:07:21,863
Oh, yes. You're already
practicing your salute, huh?

2107
02:07:21,907 --> 02:07:24,736
Yes, you are. Well, we'll
take care of that, won't we?

2108
02:07:24,779 --> 02:07:27,565
Jesus Christ! This is
so much harder than I thought.

2109
02:07:28,392 --> 02:07:30,045
Oh, I'm going to hell.

2110
02:07:30,089 --> 02:07:31,786
That makes two of us.

2111
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:33,440
You can do this.

2112
02:07:33,484 --> 02:07:36,138
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy. This is crazy.

2113
02:07:36,182 --> 02:07:37,314
All right.

2114
02:07:44,669 --> 02:07:47,062
Maximum effort.

2115
02:13:24,748 --> 02:13:27,054
That's okay.
Let me see here.

2116
02:13:27,098 --> 02:13:28,621
Oh, God.

2117
02:13:28,665 --> 02:13:30,623
That's why you're
such a little bastard.

2118
02:13:30,667 --> 02:13:33,017
No one's ever changed you.

2119
02:13:33,060 --> 02:13:35,802
Yeah, you got a big, old
stinky in there, don't you?

2120
02:13:35,846 --> 02:13:38,675
God, it smells like
Hitler's anus...

2121
02:13:38,718 --> 02:13:41,286
which would makes sense,
wouldn't it? Yeah.

2122
02:13:41,329 --> 02:13:42,504
I think we both know

2123
02:13:42,548 --> 02:13:43,960
I don't have
what it takes to do this...

2124
02:13:43,984 --> 02:13:46,160
so I'm just gonna change
your diaper real quick...

2125
02:13:46,204 --> 02:13:48,138
and then I'm gonna come back
with my friend, Cable.

2126
02:13:48,162 --> 02:13:49,555
He loves killing kids.
